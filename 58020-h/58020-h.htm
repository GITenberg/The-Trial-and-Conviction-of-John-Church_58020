<h2><a name="pageiii"></a><span class="pagenum">p. iii</span>TO
THE PUBLIC.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">In</span> presenting to you the following
account of the Trial of <span class="smcap">John Church</span>,
for an attempt to commit one of the foulest crimes recognized by
the law of nature, the Publishers have no wish to echo the
triumphs of a party&mdash;they are actuated only with a desire to
hold up the abominable wretch to general observation, that
innocent youths may not unguardedly become the victims of his
brutal passion&mdash;the occasion calls for sorrow rather than
joy; and the Christian Philanthropist will feel more inclined to
shed the silent tear, than indulge in exultation, while he
peruses this record of human degradation.</p>
<p>In some cases, it appears desirable not to suffer trials of a
criminal nature to appear in print, particularly when the facts
are too indecent, lest the tender feelings of any should be
injured, or that information given which had better be withheld;
but when the subject of conviction is a creature, who pretends to
be the guide of hundreds in the paths of our Holy Religion, and
under its sacred name, is not only ruining the bodies, but the
souls of many of his hearers, <a name="pageiv"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. iv</span>than silence becomes a crime, and a
full exposure an imperative duty.</p>
<p>We regret, that among the followers of this wretch are to be
found many young men, who not only countenance his cause by their
presence, but advocate it with their talents;&mdash;that charity,
which covereth a multitude of sins, leads us to indulge the hope,
that hitherto they have acted conscientiously and from
principle&mdash;that they have believed their leader was the
object of cruel persecution&mdash;that he suffered for
righteousness sake&mdash;and under this impression, we pity
rather than condemn them; but can they be of the same opinion
now?&nbsp; We request their attentive perusal of the following
pages; we beg of them to notice the evidence produced for the
prosecution, particularly the copy of a letter to Mrs. Hunter,
the original of which was artfully suppressed, and the admission
of Church himself, and then say, whether this <i>conviction</i>
does not &ldquo;<i>confirm ancient reports</i>?&rdquo;&nbsp; Let
them read the contradictory evidence of Thomas, and the
observations made thereon by the learned Judge who tried the
prisoner; let those who were present remember his agitated
appearance in Court, and the manner in which he unwillingly
confirmed the evidence of the prosecutor&rsquo;s master, and then
say on which side the <i>truth</i> appears to preponderate.&nbsp;
If the hearers of Church do not wilfully close their eyes, and
pervert <a name="pagev"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
v</span>their judgments, they can have but one opinion, viz. that
the verdict of the jury is the verdict of every one who values
the cause of religion, morality, and virtue.</p>
<p>If however, the hearers of this creature still continue to
frequent this &ldquo;Tabernacle of Iniquity,&rdquo; every person
will naturally believe, that other motives, and not a desire to
be edified by the ministrations of their <i>convicted</i> pastor,
actuate them&mdash;they will ever be looked upon with a
suspicious eye, and their character, and every thing that is dear
to them in this life, will be sacrificed for ever, in the opinion
of every good man.</p>
<p>It may be expected that something should be said of the
conduct of those females who have so long patronized this
deceiver of their souls.&nbsp; How can they longer listen to a
wretch who must <i>detest</i> them in his heart, and nothing but
his love of gain makes him court their friendship?&nbsp; Can they
now, in the presence of a disgusted public, enter the doors of
his &ldquo;den of thieves?&rdquo;&mdash;If they can, friends must
blush for the inconsistency of their conduct: most sincerely do
we hope that all who respect their reputation will never approach
&ldquo;the Surrey Tabernacle&rdquo; until the present occupier
and all his associates have left the place.</p>
<p>Much praise is due to those who have at last brought <span
class="smcap">John Church</span> to justice: every thing that <a
name="pagevi"></a><span class="pagenum">p. vi</span>could be done
by bribery and persuasion were resorted to by his friends; but
they found the Prosecutor, in this respect, invulnerable.&nbsp;
The youth has acted nobly; and the praises of the Public are due
to him for his resistance to the wishes of that wretch, who would
have gloried in being the murderer of his peace for ever!</p>
<p>One fact however, as it reflects considerable <i>credit</i> on
the <i>respectability</i> of the Defendant and his legal friend,
must not be omitted&mdash;the person employed to <i>defend</i>
the Prisoner was a Jew Attorney, very well known to many.&nbsp;
He applied to the Prosecutor&rsquo;s father several times, and
tendered his services to conduct the prosecution, assuring him he
should not expect any pecuniary remuneration for his exertions in
bringing such a character to justice.&nbsp; He advised the
Father, as he was a poor man, to accept a sum of money, if it
were offered, and compromise the business: this proposal was
indignantly rejected, and the man treated as he deserved to
be&mdash;with merited contempt.&nbsp; We regret also that a man,
whose duty is the apprehension of transgressors against our laws,
should have interfered most unjustly to hush up the matter.</p>
<p>Some, perhaps, may think that too much severity appears in our
observations against the Prisoner&mdash;but, can this be the
case?&nbsp; Can any man feel too indignant at the conduct of such
miscreants?&mdash;We cordially <a name="pagevii"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. vii</span>agree with the learned Counsel for
the Prisoner, that if a wish would sweep such characters from the
creation, that wish would be immediately expressed by every true
British heart.&mdash;Are we too severe?&nbsp; <i>Remember the
conduct of the Almighty</i>, <i>who sent fire and brimstone from
Heaven</i>, <i>and consumed the </i><span
class="smcap"><i>Guilty</i></span><i> Inhabitants of Sodom and
Gomorrah</i>, <i>lest their filthy bodies should pollute the
grave</i>.</p>
<p>The friends of the Prisoner have publicly supported him in his
defence by their Subscriptions.&nbsp; The Prosecutor has stood
almost alone; but, confident that the liberality of the Public
was never appealed to in vain&mdash;that they will always assist
the injured poor in bringing their oppressors to punishment, this
Publication is submitted to them; and they may rest assured that
the profits will be devoted towards defraying the expenses which
have been necessarily incurred in bringing this &ldquo;Monster of
Iniquity&rdquo; to Justice.</p>

<h2><a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>THE
TRIAL, &amp;c. &amp;c.</h2>
<h3>THE KING <i>versus</i> JOHN CHURCH.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Indictment charged, &ldquo;That
the Defendant, late of the parish of St. Mary, Lambeth, in the
county of Surrey, on the 26th day of September, in the
fifty-seventh year of the reign of George the Third, with force
and arms, at the parish aforesaid, in the county aforesaid, in
and upon one Adam Foreman, in the peace of God and our said Lord
the King, then and there being, did make an assault, and him, the
said Adam Foreman, then and there did beat, wound, and ill treat,
so that his life was greatly despaired of, with intent, that most
horrid, detestable, and sodomitical crime (among Christians not
to be named) called Buggery, with the said Adam Foreman, against
the order of nature, then, and there feloniously, wickedly, and
devilishly, to commit and do, to the great displeasure of
Almighty God, to the great damage of the said Adam Foreman, and
against the peace.&rdquo; &amp;c.</p>
<p>The second count charged a common assault.</p>
<p>The Defendant pleaded&mdash;<span class="smcap">Not
Guilty</span>.</p>
<p>Counsel for the Prosecution&mdash;Mr. <span
class="smcap">Marryatt</span> and Mr. <span
class="smcap">Borland</span>; Solicitor, Mr. <span
class="smcap">Harmer</span>.</p>
<p>Counsel for the Defendant&mdash;Mr. <span
class="smcap">Gurney</span> and the <span class="smcap">Common
Serjeant</span>.</p>
<p>The Jury being sworn:&mdash;Mr. <span
class="smcap">Borland</span> opened the indictment, as
follows&mdash;</p>
<p>May it please your Lordship, Gentlemen of the Jury&mdash;The
Defendant, John Church, stands indicted for a misdemeanour.&nbsp;
He has pleaded Not Guilty, and your charge is to enquire whether
he be Guilty or Not Guilty.&nbsp; Hearken to the evidence.</p>
<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Marryatt</span> then stated the case
on the part of the Prosecution, to the effect
following:&mdash;</p>
<p>May it please your Lordship, Gentlemen of the Jury&mdash;I am
extremely sorry to have occasion to state to you that the offence
imputed to the Defendant (which my Learned Friend, Mr. Bolland;
simply opened as a misdemeanour) is <a name="page10"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 10</span>an assault, with the intent to commit
an unnatural crime; and I am sure, on an occasion of this nature,
it would be unnecessary for me to bespeak your serious attention
to a charge so serious in its consequences to the
Defendant.&nbsp; The Prosecutor in this case is a youth, about
eighteen or nineteen years of age, the apprentice of a Potter at
Vauxhall, whose name is Patrick.&nbsp; He had been apprenticed to
him some time, and resided in his family.&nbsp; The Defendant is
a preacher&mdash;not of the Established Church, but of a
Dissenting Chapel, not far distant from Vauxhall, and Mr. Patrick
and his family had been in the habit of attending that Chapel and
hearing Mr. Church&rsquo;s discourses.&nbsp; Their apprentice
used frequently to accompany them to the Chapel, and by that
means he became perfectly acquainted with the person and voice of
the Defendant, Church.&nbsp; He knew him extremely well by name
and description.&nbsp; In the month of September last, Mr. Church
complained to Mr. Patrick that he was in ill health, and
attributed that circumstance to the confined situation of his
apartments near to the Chapel.&nbsp; Being ill, Mr. Patrick, as a
matter of civility and attention to the Preacher of the Chapel
which he frequented, invited him to come to Vauxhall, where he
had a spare bed, much at Mr. Church&rsquo;s service.&nbsp; Upon
this invitation, Mr. Church came, and he slept there on Monday,
the 23d of September, for the first time.&nbsp; I am not quite
certain as to the precise night he came; but on the night of the
26th day of September, the transaction occurred which gave rise
to the present proceeding.&nbsp; Mr. Patrick had left town on
business, but not before Mr. Church came in the first instance;
but during Church&rsquo;s stay he departed for the country.&nbsp;
During the master&rsquo;s absence, it became necessary for
Foreman, the apprentice, to sleep in the house.&nbsp; The only
spare bed was occupied by Church, the Defendant, and therefore a
temporary bed was made up for the apprentice.&nbsp; He had a
resting place made up for him in one of the parlours of the
house.&nbsp; It happened that on the evening when this
transaction took place, the Prosecutor had been staying up to
attend a kiln which was at work on Mr. Patrick&rsquo;s
premises.</p>
<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gurney</span>.&mdash;I am told one of
your witnesses is now in Court.</p>
<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Marryatt</span>.&mdash;I am not aware
of that circumstance.&nbsp; If he is, he must certainly go out of
Court.</p>
<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gurney</span>.&mdash;I am told Mr.
Patrick is in Court.</p>
<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Marryatt</span>.&mdash;Then I beg he
will go out; and that all the witnesses will remain outside until
they are severally called.</p>
<p>Gentlemen, I was stating to you, that on the night in
question, Mr. Patrick went out of town on some business.&nbsp; <a
name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>An occasional
bed was made up for the apprentice.&nbsp; Mr. Church occupied the
only spare bed-room in the house.&nbsp; The apprentice, I
believe, was not in the habit of sleeping in Mr. Patrick&rsquo;s
family, except when his master went out of town; for otherwise
there would be no occasion to make up a temporary bed for him, if
he was in the practice of sleeping there.&nbsp; Between twelve
and one o&rsquo;clock in the morning, the apprentice retired from
the burning of the kiln, to take his rest in the bed thus
assigned him.&nbsp; He got into bed, and went to sleep almost
immediately; and at no very great distance of time, he was
awakened by the approach of Mr. Church in his bed-room.&nbsp; Mr.
Church was not ignorant where the young man slept and the manner
in which he was accommodated.&nbsp; The apprentice was alarmed,
and certainly had no doubt of what Mr. Church&rsquo;s intention
was in coming to his bed-chamber.&nbsp; You must hear the
circumstances from the witness; and I have very little doubt that
you will be satisfied from his evidence, and that of the other
witnesses I shall have to call, that the intention of the
defendant was that imputed to him by this indictment.&nbsp; The
advances and overtures made to the apprentice in the way that he
will describe to you, must leave very little doubt in your mind
of the intention of the person who went into that room.&nbsp;
Indeed it would be very difficult to assign any good reason for
Mr. Church&rsquo;s coming there.&nbsp; The lad was
surprised.&nbsp; He awoke and laid hold of the person by the arm,
and called out, &ldquo;Who is there?&rdquo;&nbsp; The Defendant
said, in a feigned feminine voice, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know
me, Adam?&nbsp; I&rsquo;m your mistress.&rdquo;&mdash;The lad was
extremely surprised at this; he knew that it was not his
mistresses voice; and he knew by having caught hold of the shirt
sleeve of the person who addressed him, that it was not a woman,
but a man.&nbsp; In consequence of this, he endeavoured to lay
hold of him; the Defendant however retired from the room and went
up stairs.&nbsp; I told you that the lad had a temporary bed made
up for him in the parlour; and upon the defendant&rsquo;s
retiring from the room, the prosecutor had a distinct opportunity
of seeing his person; for it seems that the door of the parlour
was opposite the fan-light over the street door, through which a
light was given by the lamp in the street; and upon the
Defendant&rsquo;s retiring, the prosecutor had a distinct view of
him, and knew him extremely well to be Mr. Church.&nbsp; He
hardly knew how to act.&nbsp; He was unwilling to alarm his
mistress at that hour of the night; not indeed that it was a
story fit to be mentioned, or stated to her at any time by
him.&nbsp; He, however, went out of the house to the person whom
he had left at the kiln in <a name="page12"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 12</span>the pottery when he retired to
rest.&nbsp; That person&rsquo;s name is West; and he gave him an
account of what had passed.&nbsp; West was for going into the
house and turning the Defendant Church immediately out; but the
prosecutor said it would occasion an alarm to his mistress, and
he thought it better to postpone the business until the
morning.&nbsp; Accordingly, Mr. Church was not disturbed for that
night; but in the morning some inquiry was made by Mrs. Patrick,
who asked whether the prosecutor and the servants had not been
disturbed in the course of the night, by some persons coming up
or down stairs?&nbsp; Some explanation was given her of the cause
of the disturbance, but not to the full extent, it being thought
adviseable not to explain the whole to her, as Mr. Patrick was
returning home that night, when the prosecutor determined to
detail the whole transaction to his master.&nbsp; The prosecutor
had given his mistress some account of what had occurred, but
withholding from her that part which he thought improper for
female ears to hear.&nbsp; Mr. Patrick however came home the next
day, and the prosecutor told his story to him; and on the
following day several of Mr. Church&rsquo;s friends having heard
that the boy had told his master what had occurred, came to Mr.
Patrick to inquire what was the extent of the information he had
received.&nbsp; Mr. Patrick communicated to them the whole of the
information which the boy had given, and said he thought it
necessary that Mr. Church should explain his conduct.&nbsp; By
this time the thing was generally known and buzzed about.&nbsp;
Some of the congregation were desirous that no proceeding should
be instituted against the Defendant, as the public investigation
of such a transaction would be a disgrace to the individuals of
the congregation and to the cause of religion itself.&nbsp;
Whilst Mr. Patrick and some of his friends, who were of the same
religious persuasion, were some days hesitating about what course
to pursue, the boy&rsquo;s father came to the knowledge of the
transaction; and he without any sort of ceremony took him before
a Magistrate and laid the complaint which has given rise to this
prosecution against the Defendant, Mr. Church.</p>
<p>Much inquiry has since taken place; and the Defendant has
endeavoured to explain; the transaction as well as he could; and
he has written various letters upon the subject.&nbsp; Those
letters are here, and they are much at Mr. Church&rsquo;s service
if he thinks there is any thing contained in them which will
afford him any defence; because I do not think it right to
withhold any thing which can throw light upon such a
transaction.</p>
<p>Amongst other things which Mr. Church urged by way of
explanation, in these letters, was a contradiction of some <a
name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>of the
particulars stated the prosecutor.&nbsp; He said, that there were
some matters in the statement of the boy which he was able to
contradict.&nbsp; This declaration of Mr. Church having come to
the knowledge of Mr. Patrick, he was induced by the application
which was made to him, on the part of some of Mr. Church&rsquo;s
congregation, to make some inquiry of Mr. Church upon the
subject.&nbsp; He accordingly took occasion to have an interview
with the defendant, for the purpose of enabling himself, if he
could, to explain his conduct to the satisfaction of the persons
who are in the habit of attending his chapel.&nbsp; At that
interview, he contradicted some of the particularities stated by
the boy, but which are some of the most disgusting parts of the
narrative.&nbsp; He, however, admitted, most distinctly, that he
had gone into the lad&rsquo;s room.</p>
<p>Now, when you shall have had it proved in evidence, that part
of the conduct ascribed to him was admitted by the defendant, I
should like to know if he really did go into that bed-room, for
what possible purpose could he go there in the middle of the
night?&nbsp; It will appear, still further, that Church was the
only male person who slept in the house; for there was no other
individual of the male sex to take up his abode there that
night.</p>
<p>The question, then, will be, whether, upon the evidence I
shall produce, you can have any reasonable doubt of the
defendant&rsquo;s intention to commit the offence imputed to him
by this indictment?&nbsp; If you have no doubt of the truth of
the boy&rsquo;s story&mdash;if you have no doubt that it was the
defendant&rsquo;s intention to commit the atrocious crime charged
upon him by this prosecution, then, however painful your duty may
be, you must not be deterred by the enormity and apparent
impossibility of such a crime existing in society, from the fair
and honest discharge of it.&nbsp; There are two questions for you
to determine:&mdash;<i>First</i>, whether the defendant was the
person who entered the prosecutor&rsquo;s room?&mdash;and,
<i>Secondly</i>, if he did, whether the atrocious intention,
alleged in the indictment can clearly be inferred from his
conduct on that occasion?&nbsp; But, gentlemen, if you have any
reasonable doubt upon either of these questions, I should not, as
Counsel for the prosecution, desire you to pronounce a verdict of
guilty.&nbsp; But, whatever conclusion you may draw from his
statement, submitted to your consideration, I trust you will take
care that your indignation against the offence itself shall not
carry you to the conclusion of guilt, unless the evidence I shall
lay before you warrants the conviction of the defendant.</p>

<p>When was that?&mdash;The 25th of September, he came to sleep
there that night.</p>
<p>Do you know what was the occasion of his coming?</p>
<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gurney</span>.&mdash;That must be of
his own knowledge.</p>
<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bolland</span>.&mdash;Mr. Patrick will
tell us.&mdash;I believe he came&mdash;</p>
<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gurney</span>.&mdash;You must not tell
us, Sir, unless you know it of your own knowledge.</p>
<p>However, he came to sleep there?&mdash;Yes.</p>
<p>Did you sleep there that night?&mdash;Yes.</p>
<p>Was that the first night he came?&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know
whether he had been there before.&nbsp; I cannot say whether I
had seen him there before.</p>
<p>You know that he slept there on the 25th of September, and
that you were there?&mdash;Yes.</p>
<p>Where was your master that night?&mdash;He was out of town;
but where, I cannot say.</p>
<p>Who slept in the house that night?&mdash;Mr. Church, my
mistress, the children, and the two maid servants.</p>
<p><a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>Was
there any other man in the house, except yourself and
Church?&mdash;No.</p>
<p>Where was your bed room?&mdash;The front parlour on the first
floor.</p>
<p>That is the ground floor?&mdash;It is over the kitchen.</p>
<p>Is that a bed-room in common in the house?&mdash;No, it is
not.</p>
<p>Then how came you to sleep there?&mdash;Because there was not
any other bed-room that I could sleep in.</p>
<p>Was a temporary bed therefore put up for you
there?&mdash;Yes.</p>
<p>Now, at what time did you retire to rest?&mdash;Near one
o&rsquo;clock.</p>
<p>What had kept you up so late?&mdash;There was a kiln burning,
and I was obliged to sit up to let the man into the kiln when he
came.</p>
<p>Was it necessary for you to sit up to attend that
kiln?&mdash;Yes; and to give the key to the man.</p>
<p>Who was that man?&mdash;Thomas West.</p>
<p>And you went to bed about one o&rsquo;clock?&mdash;Yes.</p>
<p>Did you go to sleep?&mdash;Yes; directly I went to bed.</p>
<p>After you had been asleep, did any thing happen to
you?&mdash;Yes.</p>
<p>State what it was?&mdash;I had not been asleep more than half
an hour, before I was awoke by some one putting his hands under
the bed clothes, and laying hold of my private parts.</p>
<p>In what way?&mdash;Laid hold of me very tight.</p>
<p>Did you say any thing, or did the person, whoever it was, say
any thing to you?&mdash;Yes.&nbsp; I put my hand out of the bed
clothes, and caught hold of him, and asked him who he was?</p>
<p>What did you say?&mdash;I asked him who he was&mdash;I said
who are you?</p>
<p>And you say you laid hold of him?&mdash;Yes.</p>
<p>By what part did you lay hold of him?&mdash;As near as I can
guess it was the upper part of his arm.</p>
<p>Upon laying hold of him, what observation did you make?&nbsp;
What did you ascertain from laying hold of the person?&nbsp;
Could you tell whether it was a man or a woman?&mdash;I laid hold
of his arm, and felt lower down, and found by the sleeve that he
had got a man&rsquo;s shirt on.</p>
<p>How far did you feel lower down?&mdash;I had a hold of him by
the upper part of the arm, and running my hand down to the wrist,
I found he had a man&rsquo;s shirt on.</p>
<p>Could you tell whether the wrist was buttoned?&mdash;Yes.</p>
<p>Was it buttoned?&mdash;It was.</p>
<p>Could you tell at all by the feel of the arm itself, whether
<a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>it was the
arm of a man or a woman?&mdash;I knew very well it was a man.</p>
<p>Could you tell that from the feel of the flesh?&mdash;I could
not tell that.</p>
<p>By Lord <span class="smcap">Ellenborough</span>.&mdash;You
knew it was a man&mdash;By what circumstance?&mdash;Because he
had got a man&rsquo;s shirt on.</p>
<p>You knew it was a man by the shirt?&mdash;Yes.</p>
<p>By Mr. <span class="smcap">Bolland</span>.&mdash;Did the
person say any thing to you in answer to what you said?&mdash;He
answered&mdash;&ldquo;Adam, don&rsquo;t you know me?&nbsp; I am
your mistress,&rdquo; in a faint voice, like a woman.</p>
<p>And was it the voice of your mistress, Mrs. Patrick?&mdash;Oh!
no, sir!</p>
<p>Could you tell whose voice it was?&mdash;Yes; I knew the voice
directly I heard it.</p>
<p>Whose voice was it?&mdash;Mr. Church&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>What did you do afterwards, and what did he do?&mdash;He fled
from the room directly.</p>
<p>When you use the word <i>fled</i>, what do you mean by
that?&mdash;He went out of the room.</p>
<p>The word <i>fled</i> indicates more than merely going out of
the room; did he go out in a hurried manner?&mdash;He went out in
a hurried step.</p>
<p>Upon his going out what did you do?&mdash;I got out of bed,
and put on my small clothes and shoes, and went to the man up at
the kiln.</p>
<p>What did you do first&mdash;when he went out of the
room&mdash;what did you first do?&mdash;I got out of bed, and put
on my small clothes and shoes.</p>
<p>Did you see him go out of the room?&mdash;Yes.&nbsp; As he
opened the door I saw by the lamp that it was Mr. Church, and he
had only his shirt on.</p>
<p>Where is that lamp that enabled you to see the person of
Church?&mdash;Outside of the door.</p>
<p>What door do you mean?&mdash;Outside of the front street
door.</p>
<p>In the street?&mdash;Yes; on the Terrace.</p>
<p>And that lamp throws a light through the fan-light of the hall
door?&mdash;Yes.</p>
<p>By Lord <span class="smcap">Ellenborough</span>.&mdash;The
lamp is at the street door?&mdash;Yes, my Lord.</p>
<p>By Mr. <span class="smcap">Bolland</span>.&mdash;Is it a gas
light or a parish light?&mdash;It is a parish lamp.</p>
<p>It is not one of the new lights?&mdash;No.</p>
<p>It is not a gas light?&mdash;No.</p>
<p>By Lord <span class="smcap">Ellenborough</span>.&mdash;Where
were you standing at the time?&mdash;I was getting up, my
Lord.</p>
<p><a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>By Mr.
<span class="smcap">Bolland</span>.&mdash;Did you go out of your
room?&mdash;Yes, I did.</p>
<p>By Lord <span class="smcap">Ellenborough</span>.&mdash;You say
that when he went out of the room, you saw it was Church, by the
lamp: what lamp do you mean?&mdash;The lamp at the door.</p>
<p>What door?&mdash;The street door.</p>
<p>Where were you when you saw Church at that time by the light
of the lamp?&mdash;In bed, sitting up.&nbsp; I had not then left
my bed.</p>
<p>You must have opened your door?&mdash;No, my Lord; Church did
that.</p>
<p>By Mr. <span class="smcap">Bolland</span>.&mdash;Whoever the
person was, he left the door open, and you saw him go out through
that door; and then you observed that he had a shirt
on?&mdash;Yes.</p>
<p>The shirt or dress of a man is much shorter than that of a
woman, and therefore you must have seen whether it was a shirt or
a shift?&mdash;It was the shirt of a man, I am sure.</p>
<p>Did you see his face at all?&mdash;No, I did not.&nbsp; His
back was to me.</p>
<p>When he was gone, what did you do?&mdash;I then got up and put
my small clothes on, and shoes, and went into the pottery.</p>
<p>What for?&mdash;To get the man to come up to the house.</p>
<p>Did you inform any body of what had happened?&mdash;Yes; I
told Thomas West of it.</p>
<p>By <span class="smcap">Lord Ellenborough</span>.&mdash;He was
in the pottery?&mdash;Yes.</p>
<p>By Mr. <span class="smcap">Bolland</span>.&mdash;Was that the
Thomas West that was in the pottery before you went to
bed?&mdash;Yes.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>Cross-examined by</i> Mr. <span
class="smcap">Gurney</span>.</p>
<p>The person, whoever it was, you say left the door open behind
him?&mdash;No; he opened the door and went out.</p>
<p>Did he shut the door after him?&mdash;Yes.</p>
<p>Is that so?&mdash;Yes.</p>
<p>Then, if he shut the door after him, how did that enable you
to see any thing by the light?&mdash;When he opened the door I
saw him.</p>
<p>There was no light in the room?&mdash;No.</p>
<p>The light, as you say, came from a lamp on the
Terrace?&mdash;Yes.</p>
<p>How far is that lamp from the door?&mdash;Between five and six
yards from the door on the Terrace.</p>
<p>The Terrace on which your master&rsquo;s house is situated, is
a row of houses raised above the road?&mdash;Yes.</p>
<p>And the lamp is upon the Terrace opposite the
door.&mdash;Yes.</p>
<p>And about five or six yards from the door?&mdash;Yes.</p>
<p><a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>The
light which it given to your passage is, I suppose, through the
fan-light over the door?&mdash;Yes.</p>
<p>Then you mean to say that the light which came through that
fan-light into your passage enabled you to see who it was, before
the person had left the room?&mdash;When he opened the door and
went out I saw him.</p>
<p>You say that the person, whoever he was, shut the door
immediately afterwards?&mdash;Yes; but I could see him when he
opened the door.</p>
<p>Did you see the face of the person?&mdash;No.</p>
<p>How then can you pretend to say that you knew who that person
was?&mdash;I saw that the person had a shirt on.</p>
<p>Do you mean to say that you can distinguish a shirt from a
shift or a bed-gown?&mdash;I saw that it was a shirt.</p>
<p>I should imagine that on an occasion of this sort you were a
little frightened?&mdash;Yes, I was rather alarmed.</p>
<p>Waked out of your sleep in this way, you were of course rather
alarmed.&mdash;Did it not take place all in a minute?&mdash;Yes,
it was not long about.</p>
<p>Did it not take place almost instantaneously?&mdash;I
don&rsquo;t know how long he had been there before I awoke.</p>
<p>From the moment you awoke, did it not take place as fast as
possible?&mdash;Yes.</p>
<p>Now, you say you went directly to West?&mdash;Yes.</p>
<p>West and you directly came and searched the house for
thieves?&mdash;Yes.&nbsp; We did not know whether any body had
got in or not.</p>
<p>And went and looked at every chamber door in the
house?&mdash;Yes; except Mr. Church&rsquo;s and my
mistress&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Did you not look at the door of Mr. Church and that of your
mistress?&mdash;Yes; but we did not open them.</p>
<p>I suppose therefore they were both of them
shut?&mdash;Yes.</p>
<p>Did you find any door open?&mdash;No.</p>
<p>You looked at all the doors in the house and found them all
shut?&mdash;Yes; the servant&rsquo;s door was on the jar.</p>
<p>You mean the maid servant&rsquo;s door?&mdash;Yes.</p>
<p>The other doors of the house were all shut?&mdash;All the
other doors were shut.</p>
<p>And after you and he searched the house all over, you went to
bed and he went back to the pottery?&mdash;No; he stopped while I
put on the remainder of my clothes, and I went back with him to
the pottery, after having locked the door.</p>
<p>You went with him to the pottery?&mdash;Yes.</p>
<p>And you say that you told West this story directly?&mdash;Yes,
I told him that Mr. Church came down into my room and behaved in
a very indecent manner.</p>
<p>You told him, I take for granted, that Church had been there,
and laid hold of your private parts?&mdash;Yes.</p>
<p><a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>You
told him that Mr. Church had laid hold of your private
parts?&mdash;Yes.</p>
<p>How came that to be a reason for you and be searching the
house for thieves?&mdash;I did not search the house for thieves
in particular; but to search if any body was in any of the
rooms.</p>
<p>But I asked you before whether you did not search the house
for thieves; and you answered &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;&mdash;Are you
right or wrong in that?&mdash;I asked you before whether you and
he did not search the house for thieves, and you told me that you
did?&mdash;We searched the house: we looked all over it, to see
if there was any body in any of the rooms.</p>
<p>And therefore I asked you expressly whether you and he did not
search the house for thieves? and did you not say expressly that
you and he had searched the house for thieves?&mdash;We searched
the house; but not for thieves in particular.</p>
<p>Then you did not think of thieves?&mdash;I did not think of
thieves, because I knew who it was.</p>
<p>You did not go into the maid servant&rsquo;s room?&mdash;No,
we looked in.</p>
<p>You did not go in?&mdash;No; we found the door open, and
looked in.</p>
<p>They were, of course, in bed?&mdash;Yes; one was my
sister.</p>
<p>Lord <span class="smcap">Ellenborough</span>.&mdash;Did the
two maids sleep in that room?&mdash;Yes, my Lord; one is my
sister.</p>
<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gurney</span>.&mdash;The door being
ajar, you pushed it in a little, and you saw they were
abed?&mdash;Yes.</p>
<p>Lord <span class="smcap">Ellenborough</span>.&mdash;Did you
speak to them?&mdash;No.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>Re-examined by</i> Mr. <span
class="smcap">Bollard</span>.</p>
<p>You say you did not search the house for thieves?&mdash;No;
not for thieves.</p>
<p>Because you knew who the person was?&mdash;Yes.</p>
<p>Was the reason of your searching the house because you wished
to be quite right before you made the accusation against Mr.
Church?&mdash;Yes.</p>
<p>And you found that there was no other man in the
house?&mdash;We found there was no other man in the house but Mr.
Church.</p>
<p>Was there any door or window open at which any other man could
have come in?&mdash;No.</p>
<p>Now this light from the terrace, did that strike through the
fan-light or window over the door?&mdash;Yes.</p>
<p>Does it give a pretty fair light to the hall?&mdash;Yes; it
shews a little light up the stairs.</p>
<p>And at the time the person opened the door and went out, was
it at that time you got this view of his person?&mdash;Yes.</p>

<p>Now, you say that he came into the room&mdash;Did you hear him
when he first came into the room?&mdash;No.</p>
<p>You were awakened, as I understand you, by the application of
his hand to your person?&mdash;Yes.</p>
<p>Was he on the bed, or standing by the side of the bed on the
floor?&mdash;He was standing upon the floor.</p>
<p>When he assumed a feigned voice, and said, &ldquo;I am your
mistress,&rdquo; and when you observed it to be a feigned voice
in which he was speaking, did you not speak to him by name, and
say, &ldquo;It is you, Mr. Church&rdquo;&mdash;(<i>The Witness
seemed to hesitate</i>, <i>as if he had not understood the
question</i>)&mdash;Have you any difficulty in hearing?&mdash;No,
my Lord.</p>
<p>You did not call to him by name, or give him to understand
that you knew who he was?&mdash;No.</p>
<p>Did you see any part of his person or any part of his face
from which you knew, in addition to the knowledge you derived at
hearing his voice, that it was the Defendant, Church?&mdash;Yes,
I did.</p>
<p>What part of his person did you see that led you to believe it
was Mr. Church?&mdash;I saw his back as he went out of the
room.</p>
<p>Did it appear to be the height of Mr. Church?&mdash;Yes.</p>
<p>What height is he?&mdash;I cannot say.</p>
<p>What had he upon his head: had he a night-cap?&mdash;He had a
night-cap.</p>
<p>Was it a man&rsquo;s night-cap?&mdash;I cannot exactly say
whether it was or no; I think it was a handkerchief tied round
his head.</p>
<p>What sort of a handkerchief was it; was it a coloured
handkerchief?&mdash;I could not tell that.</p>
<p>When you and West searched the house and examined the
different doors, did you go to Mr. Church&rsquo;s
door?&mdash;Yes; but we did not touch it, nor did we go in.</p>
<p>Why did you not call to Mr. Church; and, as you were with
West, why did you not require that Mr. Church should appear, in
order that you might, by an immediate view, ascertain whether he
was the person who had entered your room, and acted in the way
you have described?&mdash;West wanted to go into the room and
pull him out.</p>
<p>Then, when West wanted to pull him out, why did you not, at
least, call to him?&mdash;Because I was afraid of disturbing my
mistress; she would have been very much alarmed.</p>
<p>Had he ever any conversation with you, or did he ever make any
overture of this sort to you before this time?&mdash;No, my
Lord.</p>
<p><a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>There
was nothing particular in his manner or in his conduct towards
you before this time?&mdash;No, my Lord.</p>
<p>There was nothing particular in his manner or conduct towards
you before this time?&mdash;No.</p>
<p>How soon did you see him after this to speak to him?&mdash;I
have not spoken to him at all since.</p>
<p>Have you never spoken to him since?&mdash;No, my Lord.</p>
<p>Has he not attended before a Magistrate with
you?&mdash;Yes.</p>
<p>There you spoke in his presence, but not immediately to
him?&mdash;I spoke in his presence, but not to him.</p>
<p>Upon hearing him at the Office before the Magistrate, did that
confirm the opinion you entertained of his being the person who
entered your room?&mdash;I did not hear him speak before the
Magistrate.</p>
<p>You did not hear him speak before the Magistrate?&mdash;He did
not speak at all before the Magistrate.</p>
<p>Did you give the same account before the Magistrate that you
have now done here?&mdash;Yes, my Lord.</p>
<p>You do not know whether it was a handkerchief or a night-cap
that was upon his head?&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know whether it was a
handkerchief or a night-cap.</p>
<p>Are there any other circumstances from which you could collect
that it was a man?&mdash;No, my Lord.</p>
<p>Did the hand continue upon your person for any length of time,
and for how long?&mdash;Not after I waked at all.</p>
<p>The hand was withdrawn then?&mdash;Yes.</p>
<p>And did the person say any thing to you?&mdash;He said that he
was my mistress.</p>
<p>By the height of the person you saw, you could ascertain
whether it was or was not the height of your mistress, or any of
the female part of the house?&mdash;Yes; Mr. Church was a great
deal bigger than any body there.</p>
<p>What is the size of Mr. Church?&mdash;I don&rsquo;t think he
is quite six foot to my knowledge.</p>
<p>Is he a tall man or a short man?&mdash;He is a tallish stout
man.</p>
<p>Was there light enough by the lamp that you have spoken of to
see the outline of the man so as to be able to say that he was a
tall person?&mdash;Yes.</p>
<p>What sort of a person is Mrs. Patrick?&mdash;She is a very
little woman.</p>
<p>Quite a different person from the person you saw in the
room?&mdash;O yes, my Lord, quite so.</p>
<p>The maid, who slept in the room with your sister, what was her
person and size?&mdash;She was about at tall as I
am&mdash;(<i>The Witness was about five feet seven</i>)&mdash;not
quite so tall.</p>
<p>You are sure it was not her?&mdash;O yes, my

<p>Are you workman to Mr. Patrick, the Potter?&mdash;Yes.</p>
<p>Did you, on the morning of the 26th September last relieve
Adam Foreman at the kiln?&mdash;I did.</p>
<p>About what time of that morning did you relieve
him?&mdash;About half-past twelve o&rsquo;clock.</p>
<p>You went to the Pottery to relieve him?&mdash;Yes.</p>
<p>Did he leave you shortly afterwards for the purpose of going
to bed?&mdash;Yes, he did.</p>
<p>How long had he left you before you saw him again?&mdash;About
an hour.</p>
<p>When you saw him again, was he dressed or only part
dressed?&mdash;Only part.</p>
<p>What part of his dress had he on?&mdash;He had his
small-clothes, his shoes, and one stocking.</p>
<p>When he came to you in that condition, did he state to you any
thing that had passed since he left you?&mdash;He came to me in a
very great fright, and bid me light my candle; he appeared very
much alarmed, and bid me light my candle, and come along with
him.</p>
<p>Where were you to go with him?&mdash;Up to the house.</p>
<p>What did he state to you that had passed?&mdash;He told me, as
we were going along the garden, that Mr. Church had been to him
and behaved in a very indecent manner.</p>
<p>Did he explain how?&mdash;No, he did not.</p>
<p>Did you go into the house with him?&mdash;Yes; he unlocked the
door, and we went in.</p>
<p>The door of what?&mdash;The back door, where we went into the
house.</p>
<p>The outer door?&mdash;Yes.</p>
<p>The garden door?&mdash;Yes.</p>
<p>When you got to the house, what did you and he do?&mdash;He
went and put the remainder of his clothes on.</p>
<p>Well; what did you and he do?&mdash;We went and searched every
room in the house, beginning at the bottom, and going on upwards
to the top, except my mistress&rsquo;s room and Mr.
Church&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Did you go into all the other rooms; did you open them
all?&mdash;We went into all the rooms except Mr. Church&rsquo;s
and Mrs. Patrick&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>You did not go into Mr. Church&rsquo;s room, or into that of
your mistress?&mdash;No.</p>
<p>Did you open the doors of those two rooms?&mdash;We did not
open the door of either of those two rooms.</p>
<p>When you came to Mr. Church&rsquo;s door, did you say any <a
name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
23</span>thing?&mdash;Yes; I said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go and pull
him out; shall I?&rdquo;&nbsp; The lad said, &ldquo;No,&rdquo;
for fear of disturbing his mistress.</p>
<p>Upon that observation of the lad&rsquo;s about disturbing his
mistress, did you forbear going into the room?&mdash;Yes, I
did.</p>
<p>What became of Foreman for the rest of the night?&mdash;He
came along with me into the Pottery; he came down stairs, locked
the back door, and staid with me the whole of the remainder of
the night; he returned with me to the Pottery, and staid
&rsquo;til the morning.</p>
<p>Now, for what purpose did you search in all the rooms of the
house?&mdash;To see if there was any other person in the
place.</p>
<p>Did you find any window or door open, at which any body could
have got into the house?&mdash;No; I saw them all close and
fastened.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>Cross-examined by the</i> <span
class="smcap">Common Serjeant</span>.</p>
<p>When he came to you, he told you that Mr. Church had been

<p>That you are quite sure of?&mdash;Yes.</p>
<p>Lord <span class="smcap">Ellenborough</span>.&mdash;What words
did he use?&mdash;He only told me that Church had behaved in a
very indecent manner to him.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Common Serjeant</span>.&mdash;You had
never any intimation that there were thieves in the house?&nbsp;
You did not go to search for thieves in the house?&mdash;When he
told me that Church behaved in a very indecent manner to him, I
went to see if there was any other person in the place.</p>
<p>Did he not tell you he believed there were thieves in the
house?&mdash;No.</p>
<p>Lord <span class="smcap">Ellenborough</span>.&mdash;I think
you are misled by what the witness, Foreman, said.&nbsp; It is a
mere form of expression.&nbsp; You are going upon a wrong
scent.&nbsp; The witness did not say, in terms, that he believed
there were thieves in the house.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Common Serjeant</span>.&mdash;That was
particularly mentioned by Foreman in his examination.</p>
<p>Lord <span class="smcap">Ellenborough</span>.&mdash;He might
have used the word thieves; but it is very unimportant.&nbsp; It
is giving a consequence to a phraze that is in very common use,
and means very little.</p>
<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gurney</span>.&mdash;I put the
question to him in terms, whether he did not go to search for
thieves in the house.</p>
<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Marryatt</span>.&mdash;He adopted the
whole of the sentence certainly, in the answer he gave to the
question.</p>
<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bolland</span>.&mdash;There were two
propositions in the question, which was, whether West and the
witness did <a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
24</span>not go directly in search of thieves? and the answer
applied to the first part of the question&mdash;&ldquo;as to
going together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lord <span class="smcap">Ellenborough</span>.&mdash;It is a
very common expression, and no consequence ought to be attached
to it.</p>
<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gurney</span>.&mdash;We had heard
before that he had made use of that phrase, and therefore we were
desirous of questioning him about it.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Common Serjeant</span>.&mdash;You are
quite sure he did not explain in what way this man behaved to
him?&mdash;No.</p>
<p>Did he say any thing like this:&mdash;&ldquo;That he came to
his bed-side, and laid his hand upon his private
parts?&rdquo;&mdash;No, Sir.</p>
<p>This was on the night of the 25th of September?&mdash;Yes.</p>
<p>You, I believe, afterwards went before the Magistrate, at the
same time with Foreman the apprentice?&mdash;Yes.</p>
<p>To Union Hall?&mdash;Yes.</p>
<p>Lord <span class="smcap">Ellenborough</span>.&mdash;Did he not
in the course of the morning, when staying with you, and after
you had been to the house, tell you what Church had done to him,
and that he had laid his hand upon his private
parts?&mdash;No.</p>
<p>Never, from first to last?&mdash;No.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Common Serjeant</span>.&mdash;Pray, at
what time was it that you went before the Magistrate with this
young man?&nbsp; Was it at all earlier than the 12th of November
following?&mdash;I cannot say the day of the month.</p>
<p>Was it not six or seven weeks afterwards?&mdash;It was some
time afterwards.</p>
<p>Was it not six or seven weeks after?&mdash;I believe it
was.</p>
<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Marryatt</span>.&mdash;Did the lad
then go with his father?&mdash;Yes.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Common Serjeant</span>.&mdash;The lad
generally slept at home at his father&rsquo;s?&mdash;Yes.</p>
<p>Now, how far was his father&rsquo;s off from his
master&rsquo;s?&mdash;About a quarter of a mile.</p>
<p>Did he not sleep at his father&rsquo;s the next
night?&mdash;The next but one he did.</p>
<p>And yet it was not till about six or seven weeks after that,
you went to the justice?&mdash;No.</p>
<p>Lord <span class="smcap">Ellenborough</span>.&mdash;Did you
communicate with Mr. Patrick upon the subject before you went to
the Justice.&mdash;No, my Lord.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Mr. Patrick <i>sworn</i>.&nbsp;
<i>Examined by</i> Mr. <span class="smcap">Bolland</span>.</p>
<p>You are a potter at Vauxhall?&mdash;Yes.</p>
<p>How long was the boy, Foreman, with you?&mdash;Ever since I
have been in the pottery business, between five and six
years.</p>
<p><a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 25</span>Did he
sleep in your house?&mdash;Only occasionally.</p>
<p>Upon what occasion is it that he does sleep in your
house?&nbsp; Whenever I leave town; and then he has the key of
the pottery, there being no other male in the house.</p>
<p>Were you absent from home on the 25th September
last?&mdash;Yes.</p>
<p>Was the boy on that occasion to sleep in your
house?&mdash;Yes.</p>
<p>Where had the bed been put up for him?&mdash;It was a
chair-bed in the front parlour; a temporary bed for a nurse
occasionally.</p>
<p>Do you know the defendant, John Church?&mdash;Yes.</p>
<p>What is he, and when did you become acquainted with
him?&mdash;He is a Baptist preacher; and I first became
acquainted with him when I came to Vauxhall.</p>
<p>Did you attend his chapel?&mdash;Yes.</p>
<p>And you so became acquainted with him?&mdash;Yes.</p>
<p>Where was his residence?&mdash;Adjoining the chapel.</p>
<p>Now, in the month of September, upon any occasion, and what,
did he come to sleep at your house, and did you put a bed up for
him?&mdash;Yes.</p>
<p>On what occasion was it?&mdash;He had complained of ill health
occasionally; and thinking that he was ill, I asked him out of
friendship to take a bed at my house, supposing that the air
would be of service to him.</p>
<p>You live near the river?&mdash;No; not very close.</p>
<p>You say you were out from home on the 25th of September.&nbsp;
When did you return?&mdash;On the evening of the 26th.</p>
<p>Upon your return, did the boy, Foreman, make any communication
to you?&mdash;He did the next morning when I saw him.&nbsp; I
returned on the evening of the 26th.</p>
<p>By Lord <span class="smcap">Ellenborough</span>.&mdash;Then it
was the day but one after, namely, the morning of the 27th that
the boy made the communication to you?&mdash;Yes, my Lord.</p>
<p>By Mr. <span class="smcap">Bolland</span>.&mdash;Did you see
Foreman on the night of your return?&mdash;Not to speak with
him.</p>
<p>But on the morning of the 27th he made the communication to
you?&mdash;Yes.</p>
<p>Respecting this transaction?&mdash;Yes, respecting this
transaction.</p>
<p>What did you do upon the boy&rsquo;s making that
communication?&mdash;I told him I was extremely sorry for what
had happened.</p>
<p>You need not tell us what you told him.&nbsp; Did you make it
known?&mdash;I had many applications from the Congregation, to
whom I made it known.</p>
<p>Did the communication come first from you, or did they <a
name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 26</span>apply to you
for information?&mdash;In consequence of the information they had
received from general report, they applied to me for authentic
information.</p>
<p>Several of the Congregation made those
applications?&mdash;Yes.</p>
<p>What request was made to you, and in consequence of that
request was there any meeting upon the subject?&mdash;Yes.</p>
<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gurney</span>.&mdash;Unless Church was
present, this cannot be received as evidence.</p>
<p>The <span class="smcap">Common Serjeant</span>.&mdash;And even
if he was present I apprehend it cannot be received, unless it is
evidence of a fact.</p>
<p>Lord <span class="smcap">Ellenborough</span>.&mdash;It is no
evidence of a fact; but in consequence of something said by the
Congregation respecting this subject, the witness did
something.&nbsp; The question may be put in that shape.</p>
<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gurney</span>.&mdash;If my learned
Friend goes to that, I have no objection to that question.</p>
<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bolland</span>.&mdash;I was going on
to put that question, if I had not been stopt by my learned
Friend.</p>
<p>By Mr. <span class="smcap">Bolland</span>.&mdash;In
consequence of applications made to you from the Congregation,
did you go to the Defendant, Church?&mdash;I did.</p>
<p>What did you state to Church; and when did you go to him upon
this subject?&mdash;I think it was on the 9th of October.</p>
<p>Had there not before that been a meeting of the Congregation,
at which you were present?&mdash;No.</p>
<p>By Lord <span class="smcap">Ellenborough</span>.&mdash;Did you
take any steps between the 27th of September, to see Church, and
the 9th of October, upon this subject?&mdash;No, my Lord.</p>
<p>That was the first communication you had with Church upon this
subject?&mdash;Yes.</p>
<p>By Mr. <span class="smcap">Bolland</span>.&mdash;What did you
say to him, or he to you, upon your going to him?&mdash;He took
it extremely kind of me in calling upon him.&nbsp; I told him he
might take it as he pleased; that I did not come willingly, but
that some of his Congregation thought that I ought to see him on
the business.</p>
<p>By Lord <span class="smcap">Ellenborough</span>.&mdash;Did he
appear to be apprized of the subject before you began?&mdash;I
cannot say that, my Lord, exactly.&nbsp; But I believe he was
apprized from what afterwards occurred.</p>
<p>By Mr. <span class="smcap">Bolland</span>.&mdash;What passed
on that occasion between you and him?&mdash;I told him I waited
upon him, having seen a letter wherein he denied three particular
points of the boy&rsquo;s statement; and I wished to know what
those points were.</p>
<p><a name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>You
told him you had seen a letter that he had written upon the
subject?&mdash;Yes.</p>
<p>By Lord <span class="smcap">Ellenborough</span>.&mdash;You
told him you had seen a letter upon the subject, in which he
denied three particular points of the boy&rsquo;s
statement?&mdash;Yes.</p>
<p>By Mr. <span class="smcap">Bolland</span>.&mdash;What did he
say to that?&mdash;He said that he denied having hold of the boy,
or the boy having hold of him; or he, Church, saying, that he was
the boy&rsquo;s mistress.</p>
<p>He denied the boy having hold of him, or that he, Church,
having said that he was the boy&rsquo;s mistress?&mdash;Yes.</p>
<p>Did he say whether or not he was in the room?&mdash;He
admitted that fact.</p>
<p>But denied the laying hold of the boy&rsquo;s private
parts?&mdash;Yes.&nbsp; He denied the laying hold.</p>
<p>Did he state any reason for being in the room?&mdash;Not at
all.</p>
<p>By Lord <span class="smcap">Ellenborough</span>.&mdash;When
you say that he admitted being in the room, will you, as far as
you can, state the words: state what he said?&mdash;He said that
he denied three particular points, two of which I have already
named.&nbsp; The other was something that did not occur to me to
be important, and which I did not take any notice of, and
consequently I do not remember it.&nbsp; I told him that of these
two points, that I have mentioned, the boy was positive, and I
had no reason to doubt any thing that the boy had said, as I had
never known him to tell a lie.&nbsp; He said that he was sorry
for it, because that confirmed <i>ancient reports</i>.&nbsp; I
told him it did so; and of course I told him that now I should
believe all that I had heard heretofore; and I wished him a good
morning.</p>
<p>Now did you see him at any time afterwards?&mdash;Not to speak
to him.</p>
<p>By Lord <span class="smcap">Ellenborough</span>.&mdash;You
have seen him, but not spoken to him since?&mdash;I have not
spoken to him since, my Lord.</p>
<p>By Mr. <span class="smcap">Bolland</span>.&mdash;What letter
was it that you had seen which you spoke to him about?&mdash;A
letter dated the 6th of October, addressed to a Mrs. Hunter, I
took an exact copy of it.&nbsp; Mr. Harmer has it.</p>
<p>Is that the copy?&nbsp; (<i>A paper put into the
witness&rsquo;s hand</i>.)</p>
<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gurney</span>.&mdash;I cannot see how
this can be evidence, until they prove the original to be
destroyed.</p>
<p>Lord <span class="smcap">Ellenborough</span>.&mdash;This is
only <i>a provisional</i> question.</p>
<p>By Mr. <span class="smcap">Bolland</span>.&mdash;Is that the
copy?&mdash;Yes, it is an exact copy.</p>
<p>By Lord <span class="smcap">Ellenborough</span>.&mdash;Did you
read that copy <a name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
28</span>of the letter to him?&mdash;No, my Lord, I had not the
copy at that time.</p>
<p>By Mr. <span class="smcap">Borland</span>.&mdash;What did you
state to him respecting the letter?&mdash;I told him I wished to
know what the three things were which he could deny, as asserted
by the boy?</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t recollect the third point?&mdash;No.</p>
<p>By Lord <span class="smcap">Ellenborough</span>.&mdash;You say
it is not material?&mdash;No, my Lord.</p>
<p>By Mr. <span class="smcap">Bolland</span>.&mdash;And you say
he admitted being in the room, but denied the laying
hold?&mdash;Yes.</p>
<p>In what terms did he admit that he was in the room?&mdash;He
said, &ldquo;I was in the room; but I did not lay hold of the
boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By <span class="smcap">Lord Ellenborough</span>.&mdash;Did he
say why he was in the room?&mdash;No, my Lord.</p>
<p>What did you do with the letter of the 6th of October?&mdash;I
returned it to Mrs. Hunter.</p>
<p>From whom did you get it?&mdash;From Mrs. Hunter.</p>
<p>And to Mrs. Hunter you returned it?&mdash;Yes.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>Cross-examined by</i> Mr. <span
class="smcap">Gurney</span>.</p>
<p>You mean to say that he said distinctly to you that he was in
the room?&mdash;Yes.</p>
<p>Did you mention to any person after you had seen Mr. Church,
that he was not implicated in the affair at
all?&mdash;No.&mdash;That <i>I</i> said <i>he</i> was not
implicated?&mdash;No!&nbsp; I never said any such thing.</p>
<p>Did you give any person an account of the conversation you had
with him, and accompany that account with this observation,
&ldquo;He is not at all implicated&rdquo;?&mdash;Never.</p>
<p>Not to any person?&mdash;No; not to any person.</p>
<p>Did any person go with you to Mr. Church?&mdash;Mr. Thomas
went to the door with me.</p>
<p>Is he a friend of your&rsquo;s?&mdash;He is no friend of
mine.&nbsp; I had only seen him at the door.&nbsp; It was
<i>his</i> wife and mine that wished me to make the application
to Mr. Church.</p>
<p>Then Mr. Thomas went with you as far as the door, but did not
go in with you?&mdash;No.</p>
<p>Do you recollect having any conversation with Mr. Thomas, in
which you told him what had taken place between you and Mr.
Church?&mdash;I told him briefly what had transpired; it was very
short what did transpire.</p>
<p>And you told Mr. Thomas what had transpired at the interview
with Mr. Church, when you came out?&mdash;Yes.</p>
<p>Then did you tell Mr. Thomas that Mr. Church admitted having
been in the room?&mdash;I think I did; but I am not very <a
name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 29</span>positive as
to that point.&nbsp; I know I told him that Mr. Church said that
he did not lay hold of the boy.</p>
<p>The question I wish to put to you is this&mdash;whether Mr.
Thomas did not ask you this question, &ldquo;Well, is there any
thing against Mr. Church, or not?&rdquo;&mdash;and whether you
did not answer, &ldquo;No, he is not at all
implicated?&rdquo;&mdash;I never made any such answer to him.</p>
<p>Neither that, nor any thing conveying that
meaning?&mdash;Never.</p>
<p>By <span class="smcap">Lord Ellenborough</span>.&mdash;You
never did tell him, directly or indirectly, that there was
nothing to implicate Mr. Church?&mdash;No, never.</p>
<p>By Mr. <span class="smcap">Gurney</span>.&mdash;Did you either
tell Mr. Thomas, or any other person that you would prosecute Mr.
Church, because he had said disgraceful things of your
wife?&mdash;I did; but not for this crime, but for defamation of
my wife&rsquo;s character.</p>
<p>By <span class="smcap">Lord Ellenborough</span>.&mdash;You
told Mr. Thomas that you intended to prosecute Mr. Church for
defaming your wife&rsquo;s character?&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know
that I ever told Mr. Thomas; but I believe I have said that, or
words to that effect, to other persons.</p>
<p>By Mr. <span class="smcap">Gurney</span>.&mdash;Did you not
tell Mr. Thomas that you were determined to prosecute Church for
having said disrespectful things of your wife?&mdash;I may have
told him amongst other persons.</p>
<p>Did you not mention that, amongst other things, on that very
morning that you had the interview with Mr. Church?&mdash;No;
certainly not.&nbsp; Some other time I might.</p>
<p>By <span class="smcap">Lord Ellenborough</span>.&mdash;Was it
after that morning?&mdash;Yes, my Lord, it must have been a
considerable time after that.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>Re-examined by</i> Mr. <span
class="smcap">Bolland</span>.</p>
<p>What did you inform him that you intended to institute a
prosecution against Church for?&mdash;For defamation of my
wife&rsquo;s character.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Ellenborough</span>.&mdash;That I
suppose is your case?</p>
<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Marryatt</span>.&mdash;No, my Lord, I
am going to call Mrs. Hunter.</p>
<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hunter</span> sworn.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>Examined by</i> Mr. <span
class="smcap">Marryatt</span>.</p>
<p>I believe you are an attendant amongst the congregation, and a
hearer of Mr. Church?&mdash;Yes.</p>
<p>Did he at any time write to you, early in the month of October
last?&mdash;I received a letter in the beginning of the month of
October, but there was no name to it.</p>
<p><a name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>There
was no place of abode given, or any thing except the day of the
month?&mdash;No.</p>
<p>Did you know from whom it came?&mdash;I cannot tell.</p>
<p>Did you put that letter into the hands of Mr. Patrick?&mdash;I
gave it to Mr. Patrick&rsquo;s daughter, who gave it to her
father.</p>
<p>Was that letter returned to you again?&mdash;It was; but I
took no farther notice of it.</p>
<p>Was that letter returned to you again?&mdash;Yes.</p>
<p>You had a subp&oelig;na <i>duces tecum</i> to produce
it?&mdash;I had but it is impossible to produce it.</p>
<p>Why is it impossible to produce it?&mdash;I will tell you
why.&nbsp; After the letter was returned to me, I took no further
notice of it.&nbsp; I put it into a drawer; but I know no more
than his Lordship what is become of it; I looked for it on the
Thursday morning before I came, but I could find no scraps of
it.&nbsp; I was not able to find it.</p>
<p>Then you were wholly unable to find it?&mdash;I was.</p>
<p>By Lord <span class="smcap">Ellenborough</span>.&mdash;Did you
search diligently to find it?&mdash;I did, indeed, my Lord.</p>
<p>By Mr. <span class="smcap">Marryatt</span>.&mdash;Are you
convinced there was no name to it?&mdash;I am.</p>
<p>Are you acquainted with Mr. Church&rsquo;s hand
writing?&mdash;I have seen his writing, and I have seen it
written in a different hand: not always alike, but sometimes very
different: not to say exactly two different hands, but such a
difference in the same hand writing, that you would hardly think
it was the same.&nbsp; I have seen it so different, at times,
that I should not at all times think it was the same.</p>
<p>Upon receiving the letter in question, whose hand writing did
you believe it to be, and state it to be?</p>
<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gurney</span>.&mdash;I submit to your
Lordship, that this is not a legal question.</p>
<p>Lord <span class="smcap">Ellenborough</span>.&mdash;It is not
evidence of the fact: but it is a proper question to refresh her
recollection, as to whether she did not receive a letter which
she believed to be the hand writing of the defendant.</p>
<p>By Mr. <span class="smcap">Marryatt</span>.&mdash;Whose hand
writing did you think that letter to be?&mdash;I rather think it
was Mr. Church&rsquo;s, but I could not be positive, as there was
no name to it.</p>
<p>Do you now believe that letter to be Mr. Church&rsquo;s
writing.&mdash;I cannot say whether it was or was not.&nbsp; It
is not in my power.</p>
<p>By Lord <span class="smcap">Ellenborough</span>.&mdash;You are
not asked whether it was or was not: but what your belief was
then, and what it is now?&mdash;I believed at that time, I must
own, that it was his hand writing, and I still believe the
same.</p>
<p><a name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 31</span>By Mr.
<span class="smcap">Marryatt</span>.&mdash;Did you not then
believe it to be Mr. Church&rsquo;s hand writing?&mdash;I did
rather think it was.</p>
<p>Did you, or not, believe it was?&mdash;Is there any difference
between <i>thinking</i> and <i>believing</i>?</p>
<p>That is a phrase we sometimes use in courts of justice.</p>
<p>I could not be positive; but I rather think it was his hand
writing.</p>
<p>When you opened it, did you read it as a letter coming from
him?&mdash;I was very much struck with the similarity, for it had
very much the appearance of his hand writing; but, as no name was
subscribed at the bottom, I could not be certain.&nbsp; It had
the appearance of his hand writing.</p>
<p>Is it your belief now, that it was or was not, his hand
writing?&mdash;It is exactly the same as it was then.</p>
<p>And it is now your belief that it was his hand
writing?&mdash;I cannot say I firmly believe it, because it was
not signed.</p>
<p>You are only asked whether you so acted as if it was his hand
writing?&mdash;I did not communicate it to anybody but Mr.
Patrick.</p>
<p>Did you communicate to Mr. Patrick that you had received a
letter from Mr. Church?&mdash;I did.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>Cross-examined by the</i> <span
class="smcap">Common Serjeant</span>.</p>
<p>The search which you made for this letter was not until last
Thursday?&mdash;Exactly so.</p>
<p>For any thing you know, might it not be in your house
now?&mdash;I have no reason to believe that it is, for I did not
leave a drawer or place unsearched.</p>
<p>Lord <span class="smcap">Ellenborough</span>.&mdash;As far as
evidence can go of the loss of an original letter, to let in the
copy, we have it in this case; for I asked her whether she made
diligent search after the original, and she says, she has made
diligent search.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Mr. Patrick <i>examined again
by</i> Mr. <span class="smcap">Marryatt</span>.</p>
<p>Were you acquainted in October last with the hand-writing of
Mr. Church?&mdash;Yes.</p>
<p>You told us you made this copy from the letter you had from
Mrs. Hunter.&nbsp; Was the letter from which you made this copy,
and which you returned to Mrs. Hunter, in your belief, the
hand-writing of Mr. Church?&mdash;It was.</p>
<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Marryatt</span>.&mdash;Now, my Lord, I
propose reading this copy of the letter in question.</p>
<p>The following letter was then read in evidence:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Mrs. Hunter</span>,</p>
<p>&ldquo;My heart is already too much affected.&nbsp; Your
letter only adds affliction to my bonds.&nbsp; But I
forbear.&nbsp; I would have called on you this morning, but I was
too low in mind <a name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

what you have been told.&nbsp; I must bear it, though I am able
to contradict <i>three things</i> I would rather not.&nbsp; Mr.

grieved that dear Mrs. P. whom I really loved, that she should
try to injure me in the estimation of those who are real friends
to my dear children.&nbsp; The thought affects me.&nbsp; Why hurt
my poor family?&nbsp; But I am too much depressed to
enlarge.&nbsp; I shall never forget their kindness.&nbsp; God
will reward them, as he has many who have dealt well to me.&nbsp;
But he will resent cruelty in those who have and are still trying
to degrade me.&nbsp; Mrs. P. will live to see it.&nbsp; Dear Mrs.
Hunter, I am grieved at heart I cannot relieve your mind.&nbsp; I
am truly sorry to lose you as a hearer, because your soul has
been blest; and you know both the plague of the heart and the
value of Jesus.&nbsp; May he be increasingly present to you in
his person, love, and grace!&nbsp; Farewell, my dear kind
friend!&nbsp; The Lord Jesus will reward you for your love to me,
and your kindness to mine.&nbsp; God is not unrighteous to forget
your work of faith and labour of love.&nbsp; With many tears I
write this.&nbsp; May we meet in glory, when no enemy shall
distress my mind, nor sin nor death shall part us more!&nbsp; I
need not remind my dear friend that I am a <i>Child</i> of
<i>Peculiar Providence</i>; and that <i>heart</i> of eternal
love, and that <i>arm</i> of invincible power has protected
me&mdash;has called me to himself; and for every act of straying,
will correct me with <i>his own hand</i>, but will resent
<i>every other hand</i>, sooner or later.&nbsp; This you will
live to see.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Marryatt</span>.&mdash;My Lord, that
is the case on the part of the prosecution.</p>
<h3>DEFENCE.</h3>
<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gurney</span> then addressed the Jury
on the part of the defendant, as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>May it please your Lordship&mdash;</p>
<p>Gentlemen of the Jury&mdash;Gentlemen, I must agree with my
Learned Friend, in entreating you to bestow your most serious
attention upon this case, and in requesting you to consider
(which, indeed, my Learned Friend fairly confessed you ought to
bear in mind), that as the charge is heavy the proof ought to be
clear; and that you will take care that your indignation against
the crime shall have no <a name="page33"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 33</span>influence upon your judgment
respecting the person accused.&nbsp; That is a duty, Gentlemen,
which is one of the most important, for a Juryman to attend to in
this species of case, but it in one of most difficult
performance; for such is, and such I trust ever will be, the
feeling of abhorrence which Englishmen entertain against this
detestable crime, that it is extremely difficult indeed, when a
person is accused of it, to consider the case which in laid
before us, in that dispassionate and unprejudiced manner, which
is essential to the administration of justice.&nbsp; We all wish
that no such occurrences could exist; and if a wish could blot
them out of existence, we should be almost tempted to form that
wish: but, Gentlemen, when these cases do come before us, they
claim our very serious attention; and more particularly on this
account, that it is a charge which, whenever made upon an
individual, depends almost always upon the testimony of one
witness, and where there is but one witness to make the
accusation,&mdash;I mean one witness to the fact charged, so that
the person accused can have no witness in his
defence;&mdash;that, however innocent a man may be who is accused
of this crime, provided the party is in a situation in which he
cannot shew that he was fifty miles off at the time, it is quite
impossible for him to have a witness to negative the fact.&nbsp;
It must stand or fall upon the testimony of the principal
witness, whose testimony, however, I need not tell you, is to be
watched most scrupulously, and to be compared with the evidence
of other witnesses; and if found inconsistent with the testimony
of other witnesses, it is hardly then to be carried to the extent
of full credence and of conviction.</p>
<p>Now, Gentlemen, the story which this young man has told you,
is, upon his statement, a very extraordinary one, of the attack
made upon him.&nbsp; Were any attack made upon him by Mr. Church,
it would indeed be most extraordinary under the circumstances
which he has stated.&nbsp; He represents himself to have been
previously acquainted with him&mdash;that he had been one of his
hearers&mdash;and yet from the hour of that acquaintance
commencing, to the moment of this supposed abominable attack,
that Mr. Church had never, either by word or gesture, made any
indecent overture to him of any kind, signifying his intention,
or had done any thing whatever to ascertain if he, the
prosecutor, was ready to gratify any brutal of unnatural passion
he might form.&nbsp; Now, it is a very extraordinary thing, that
it should be supposed, that a person should get out of his own
bed, and go to the bed of another, and commence the attack with
the indecencies described by the witness, without any preparation
of any kind whatever, <a name="page34"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 34</span>without having any reason to believe,
that the object of his attack would accede to his base, and
unnatural purposes, with the full knowledge, (one should think,)
that he was encountering certain detection and punishment, by the
resistance that every man would be likely to make, to such an
abominable attack; and it is, to be sure, most extraordinary to
observe in what manner this is done.&nbsp; The young man states
that he did not see the face of the person&mdash;that he felt the
arm, and found that it was a shirt sleeve; but he did not feel
any part of the flesh, so as to make any distinction between male
und female; but he concludes that it was the shirt of a man,
because the arm was covered down to the wrist.&nbsp; And when my
Learned Friend, Mr. Marryatt, supposed that females are not
covered down below the elbow, I have only to say, that I
certainly always thought that females in their night clothes were
covered down to their wrists.&nbsp; I ever understood that was
the case; and therefore a person awakened out of sleep, in the
fright that such a circumstance was likely to produce, and
finding the arm of the person making the attack covered down to
the wrist, would not, I think, be very well able to say whether
it was the sleeve of a shirt or that of a woman&rsquo;s bed-gown;
and that is all the means of knowledge which the witness has, as
far as regards feeling the person.</p>
<p>Now I go on to the next evidence of identity.&nbsp; The next
is the voice of the person who, he tells us, said in a feigned
female voice, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know me, Adam?&nbsp; I am
your mistress.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now, recollect, Gentlemen, the voice,
it is thought, is a female voice; and whether it be feigned or
not, depends upon his judgment and capacity of forming an opinion
at a moment when he was in the greatest alarm and agitation;
because if it was a female voice, then the voice was not feigned,
and it could not be Mr. Church who was in the room.&nbsp; Now, I
don&rsquo;t mean to suggest (far be it from me) that it was Mrs.
Patrick; but it is rather extraordinary and somewhat remarkable,
considering the industry and the acrimony with which this case
has been got up against Mr. Church, that they should not have
produced Mrs. Patrick as a witness, and that they should think it
right to withhold from your observation the other maid servant,
who slept with Adam Foreman&rsquo;s sister.&nbsp; I think it is
rather remarkable, that considering the industry with which I
know this case was got up, they have not thought fit to produce
that other female before you as a witness in order to say,
&ldquo;I was not out of my bed room that night, and I did not go
into the apprentices bed room.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now, I think, that
considering that the Prosecutors must have been aware of the
powerful effect of such evidence, it is most surprising that they
<a name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 35</span>did not
call forward the other persons in the house that night as
witnesses, for the purpose of shewing, by their testimony, that
they remained in their beds during the whole of that night, and
for the purpose of giving some colour of probability to this very
extraordinary and incredible story.&nbsp; But, no, Gentlemen,
they choose to leave the case to the testimony of a frightened
young man, wakened out of his sound sleep, and who, without
seeing the face of Mr. Church, ventures to swear that the feigned
female voice which he heard was that of the Defendant.&nbsp; I
think, Gentlemen, in a case in which every thing depends, not so
much upon his veracity, but upon the accuracy of his judgment in
the course of his observation upon circumstances, with respect to
which he was very little likely to draw any very accurate
conclusions, that that servant ought to have been produced here,
the more especially when the young man from the Pottery, going
afterwards through the house for the purpose of seeing who was
there, did find the female servant&rsquo;s door ajar; a
circumstance not observable with respect to any other room in the
house.</p>
<p>Now, I come to the next observation of identity; and I do
think it is a most extraordinary one.&nbsp; There is a lamp, it
seems, in the footpath of the terrace, five or six yards from the
door.&nbsp; My Learned Friend, Mr. Bolland, inquired what sort of
a lamp it was&mdash;whether it was a parish lamp, or a gas
light?&nbsp; And he found by the answer, that it was the worst
kind of lamp in the Metropolis&mdash;a parish lamp.&nbsp; Well,
then, there is a dull parish lamp, five or six yards from the
door, which gives a light through a large window&mdash;No,
through a fan-light! and the person, whoever it is, opens the
door to go out, and, as the door is opened the Lad sees that the
person has a shirt on.&nbsp; Now, I beg to ask you, as men of
sense and of experience in the world, whether it was possible for
him to see whether that garment was a shirt, a shift, or a
bed-gown&mdash;was it possible?&nbsp; Recollect, the light is not
in the room&mdash;there is some light in the passage.&nbsp; The
back of the person is towards him; and he is to tell you that it
is Mr. Church, although he only saw his back!&nbsp; But then the
next observation after the shirt, is as to the height of the
person.&nbsp; Why, Gentlemen, nothing magnifies more than fright:
nothing!&nbsp; We, all of us, have often heard the descriptions
of persons in great fright.&nbsp; They always magnify the objects
they see.&nbsp; If a person is robbed, the thief is a
<i>monstrous tall man</i>!&nbsp; Why, Gentlemen, fright does
magnify every object; and, therefore, we must make allowances for
the situation in which this young man was placed at the
time.&nbsp; He is disturbed in his sleep&mdash;the thing happens
in a moment&mdash;and he sits up in his bed in a great <a
name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
36</span>fright&mdash;and he tells you it is Mr. Church, because
of the height of the person he saw.&nbsp; Now if you can say that
a person in that station is capable of distinguishing between a
tall and a short person, I think it is a great deal too much in a
case of this sort.&nbsp; But what has the person on his
head?&nbsp; My Lord Ellenborough asked the question, <i>whether
it was a man&rsquo;s</i> or woman&rsquo;s night-cap? and he says,
&ldquo;I cannot tell whether it was a night-cap or a
handkerchief.&rdquo;&nbsp; And upon being asked the colour, he
says, &ldquo;I cannot tell.&rdquo;&nbsp; And there does not seem
to be light enough to distinguish whether it was white or
coloured.&nbsp; From this circumstance, therefore, Gentlemen, you
will judge what sort of light there was to distinguish
objects.</p>
<p>Now, Gentlemen, we come to the confirmation of this
extraordinary story, particularly by Mr. Patrick.&nbsp; It is
quite clear that Mr. Patrick has conceived some great anger
against Mr. Church, on account of supposed slander of the
character of his wife.&nbsp; Mr. Patrick himself is quite
satisfied that his wife is not guilty, any more than the maid
servant.&nbsp; But Mr. Patrick is angry, because he says, that
Mr. Church has slandered the character of his wife.&nbsp; Why
then, Mr. Patrick goes to Mr. Church, and he has some
conversation with him.&nbsp; He tells him that he has seen some
letter, but he does not mention what letter&mdash;he has seen
some letter in which he, Mr. Church, has said that he could deny
<i>three points</i> in the boy&rsquo;s story: and he puts
questions to him, and he states to you, that Mr. Church having
distinctly denied the indecent attack upon the boy, yet that he
nevertheless admitted that he was in the room.&nbsp; Now,
Gentlemen, upon that subject I must necessarily give you some
evidence, as well as upon another part of this case; for I
understand that Mr. Patrick distinctly stated to Mr. Thomas, who
accompanied him as far as the house of Mr. Church, and whom he
joined directly after he came out, that Mr. Church was not at all
implicated; for on that occasion Mr. Thomas said to him,
&ldquo;Well, is there any thing against Mr. Church?&rdquo;&nbsp;
Upon which Mr. Patrick answered &ldquo;No: Mr. Church is not all
implicated.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Patrick has denied it.&nbsp; I am
told that Mr. Thomas will positively state that to have
occurred.&nbsp; I am told so.&nbsp; Then, Gentlemen, if Mr.
Patrick be contradicted in that most material
circumstance&mdash;if you discredit him upon that part of the
case, how can you give him credit in that part upon which my
leaded friend fastened, as the confirmation of the story of the
boy&mdash;&ldquo;that he admitted to Mr. Patrick, that he had
been in the boy&rsquo;s room.&rdquo;&nbsp; But the contradiction
will not end there, Gentlemen.&nbsp; You have already one very
important contradiction in the case; <a name="page37"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 37</span>for the boy went directly to the
Pottery, and he made a communication to West; and I asked him
distinctly, and more than once, whether he stated to Mr. West
that the person who attacked him in the manner he had described,
had his hand upon his private parts? and he said that he had
distinctly told Mr. West, that Mr. Church had laid his hand on
his private parts: but, when West came to be examined, he told us
that the boy did tell him that Mr. Church had behaved in a very
indecent manner to him: but that he never, before the search was
made, nor in the course of the night, nor from first to last,
said a word to him about that circumstance.</p>
<p>Now, Gentlemen, that is a very strong contradiction of the
story told you to-day by this man; and if that induces you to
disbelieve him, or to doubt respecting his evidence, it will be
impossible for you to find the Defendant guilty of this
charge.</p>
<p>Gentlemen, I asked the boy at first, whether, instead of going
to search in request of Mr. Church, he and the potter, West, had
not gone to search for thieves? and he answered me,
&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;&nbsp; But afterwards, he gave us some
explanation, and said, &ldquo;that he did not search the house
particularly for thieves, but made a search to find if any body
was about.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now, Gentlemen, upon this subject I am
also enabled to give you some evidence, because I understand that
both the boy and West distinctly stated, when they were before
the Magistrate, that they did go and search the house for
thieves, and that they made no other search but for
thieves.&nbsp; Now, if there was any search made for
thieves&mdash;if there was any notion in the mind of this boy
that thieves were in the house, it would be quite impossible that
he could be correct in the story he has told you to-day.&nbsp;
And whether he has not magnified the thing&mdash;whether
something which he has supposed to have happened between sleeping
and awake that never happened&mdash;whether he has not been
giving you a connected account now of what he had a confused
notion then&mdash;is for your consideration.</p>
<p>But there is another circumstance respecting the case which is
very important.&nbsp; The transaction, if it ever did take place,
took place in the night of the 25th of September.&nbsp; On the
9th of October, and not until the ninth of October, does Mr.
Patrick go to Mr. Church.&nbsp; There is a lapse of a
fortnight.&nbsp; The witness whom I shall call to you will state,
that after coming out from Mr. Church&rsquo;s, Mr. Patrick
expressed himself satisfied that Mr. Church was not
implicated.&nbsp; Now let us try that by the conduct of Mr.
Patrick and of this boy.&nbsp; This is the 9th of October, and
until the 12th of November no charge before a Magistrate <a
name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 38</span>is
made.&nbsp; I beg to ask you whether the conduct of Mr. Patrick,
in forbearing to make any charge before a Magistrate until the
12th of November, is not the strongest evidence that what my
witness will state to you is true?&nbsp; That he was then
satisfied that Mr. Church was not implicated in this abominable,
odious, and unnatural transaction.&nbsp; Gentlemen, such charges
ought never to be slept upon.&nbsp; No, not for an hour.&nbsp; If
there be such a charge as that, and if it be really true that
such things have taken place, no man ought to rest on it for a
single hour.&mdash;The charge ought to be made directly.&nbsp;
But, what excuse is urged for this delay?&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo;
says my learned friend, &ldquo;At last the transaction reached
the ears of the apprentice&rsquo;s father.&rdquo;&nbsp; Why, you
wont suppose that the apprentice&rsquo;s father had just returned
from an East-India Voyage, and that the transaction coming to his
ears on the 11th of November, he brought forward the
charge.&nbsp; Gentlemen, there is no pretence for such an
excuse.&nbsp; The boy slept at his father&rsquo;s.&nbsp; He did
not sleep at his master&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Did he return to his
father&rsquo;s house?&nbsp; His father lived within a quarter of
a mile of Mr. Patrick, and he was in daily intercourse with his
father, and had abundant opportunities of conferring with him
upon the subject; and yet, for six weeks, no steps whatever are
taken to bring Mr. Church before a Magistrate.&nbsp; My learned
friend then told you that the father was the person who made the
charge: but he has not called the father.&nbsp; The only person
who appears here as the prosecutor is Mr. Patrick, and not the
father; and they have not ventured to call the father as a
witness; and there is no pretence made for the delay of this
charge, unless it was that at this interview with Mr. Church, the
prosecutor, Mr. Patrick, was satisfied, as I am told he expressed
himself to be to the person who accompanied him, and waited at
the door till he came out, that there was no ground for
implicating the Defendant in this charge: and, Gentlemen, I say
that his sleeping on the charge for upwards of a month after that
interview with Mr. Church, is the strongest evidence that at that
time he was satisfied of his innocence, and that this charge is
brought forward on account of some anger, or some supposed
declaration respecting Mr. Patrick&rsquo;s wife, which would make
him extremely angry.&nbsp; If you find, Gentlemen, that there
were no other motives than this to induce a charge of this kind,
I have no doubt you will immediately acquit the Defendant.</p>
<p>Gentlemen, I have no further observations to make.&nbsp; The
charge is most odious.&nbsp; The crime is most odious; and if it
can be more attrocious in one person than another, it is in a
person who is a public teacher of religion.&nbsp; If such a <a
name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 39</span>person, in
defiance of every law human and divine.&nbsp; In contravention of
those Sacred Scriptures, which it is his duty to read and
expound, and having read and expounded them he can be found so
far to forget every law of human nature and every principle of
virtue, by the commission of this crime, he must be the most
monstrous and attrocious of the human race, and no punishment can
be adequate to his offences.&nbsp; But the punishment which must
await him, would be infinitely worse than standing in the Court
below to receive sentence for the completion of this attrocious
crime; because I think that compared with instant death for the
consummation of the crime, the being doomed to live the object of
scorn, of hatred, and abhorrence by every human being, must be a
punishment infinitely worse.&nbsp; Gentlemen, that is not too
great for such monsters: but before you find the Defendant to be
such, be satisfied by the whole of the evidence of his
guilt.&nbsp; Compare the evidence on one side and on the other;
and if it raises a doubt in your mind, the Defendant is entitled
to the benefit of that doubt, and you will find him not
guilty.</p>
<p>Mr. John Thomas <i>was the first witness called for the
Defendant</i>, <i>and being sworn</i>, <i>was examined by the</i>
<span class="smcap">Common Serjeant</span>.</p>
<p>Is your name John Thomas?&mdash;Yes.</p>
<p>Where do you live?&mdash;In Prospect-place,
West&rsquo;s-square, St. George&rsquo;s-fields.</p>
<p>In what way of business are you?&mdash;An appraiser and
undertaker.</p>
<p>Have you known Mr. Church long?&mdash;Yes.</p>
<p>Were you one of his hearers?&mdash;Yes.</p>
<p>Were you acquainted with Mr. Patrick?&mdash;Not till the
report was made respecting Mr. Church.</p>
<p>Did you know him as one of the congregation attending Mr.
Church?&mdash;No, I cannot say I did.</p>
<p>Were you with Mr. Patrick on any day that he went to Mr.
Church&rsquo;s house&mdash;I mean on the 9th of
October?&mdash;Yes, a few days after the report.</p>
<p>Did you go into the house with him?&mdash;No, I did not.</p>
<p>You were at the door?&mdash;I staid outside.</p>
<p>Had you learnt from Mr. Patrick that he was going to Mr.
Church&rsquo;s upon the subject of this business?&mdash;Yes.</p>
<p>By Lord <span class="smcap">Ellenborough</span>.&mdash;Did he
tell you that he had a letter, and was going to make inquiries of
Mr. Church?&mdash;He called upon me at my house to go with
him.</p>
<p>By the <span class="smcap">Common Serjeant</span>.&mdash;And
told you he was going to Mr. Church&rsquo;s upon the business of
this inquiry?&mdash;Yes; indeed it was my request that he
should.&nbsp; Mr. Thomas went <a name="page40"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 40</span>to speak to his wife; and it was at
my wife&rsquo;s request and Mrs. Patrick&rsquo;s I believe that
he went.</p>
<p>Your wife joined in her request?&mdash;Yes.</p>
<p>How long might his interview with Mr. Church last&mdash;how
long was he in the house?&mdash;He seemed to be a long while; not
much less than an hour.</p>
<p>As near as you could guess, the time, was it near an
hour?&mdash;Yes.</p>
<p>When he came out did you put any questions to him respecting
what had passed between; him and Mr. Church?&mdash;Yes.</p>
<p>What questions did you put?&mdash;I asked him what Mr. Church
had said.</p>
<p>What answer did he give you?&mdash;He said that Mr. Church did
not say any thing.&nbsp; He said Mr. Church seemed very much
confounded on account of the cause, he supposed, but he said
nothing about it; that it would be injurious to the cause of
God.&nbsp; He did not say the <i>cause of God</i>, but I only
supposed he meant the cause of God.</p>
<p>By Lord <span class="smcap">Ellenborough</span>.&mdash;Did he
use the words &ldquo;cause of God?&rdquo;&mdash;No, he said Mr.
Church seemed very much confounded or confused.</p>
<p>Then the rest is all imagination of your&rsquo;s?&mdash;We
both imagined alike.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know that these were
exactly the words, for I cannot call to my mind what he did say;
but it was conjectured the cause of God, and which we heard
afterwards was abused abroad.</p>
<p>You are now called, Sir, for the purpose of
contradiction.&nbsp; You are recollecting the effect, you know,
of a conversation and communication with Mr. Patrick, and you
must say truly what passed, if you can recollect it.&mdash;I
don&rsquo;t recollect all that passed.</p>
<p>By the <span class="smcap">Common Serjeant</span>.&mdash;When
you were stopt in your account of what passed, you were going to
say something.&nbsp; You were asked whether Mr. Church had said
any thing to Mr. Patrick which Mr. Patrick related to you.&nbsp;
What did he say?&mdash;He said, No.&nbsp; He said Mr. Church
seemed very much confused.</p>
<p>What did you ask Mr. Patrick next?&mdash;&ldquo;Why,&rdquo;
said I, &ldquo;what do you mean.&nbsp; Why, if you know any thing
against the man, did you not charge him with it?&nbsp; I would
have been very faithful with him, and charged him with
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What answer did Mr. Patrick make to that?&mdash;He said he did
not know; he was not the person.</p>
<p>By Lord <span class="smcap">Ellenborough</span>.&mdash;Repeat
that in Mr. Patrick&rsquo;s own words.&nbsp; Attend, and wait to
hear the question.&nbsp; Be so good as to suppose that you were
narrating the conversation <a name="page41"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 41</span>as it occurred with Mr.
Patrick.&nbsp; Instead of saying, <i>He</i>, say <i>I</i>.&nbsp;
Attend now.</p>
<p>By the <span class="smcap">Common Serjeant</span>.&mdash;What
further did he say? and give his own words.&mdash;He said,
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know: I am not so proper a person as
you,&rdquo; or words to the same effect.&nbsp; I said to him,
&ldquo;What did he (meaning Church) say respecting the
report?&rdquo;</p>
<p>What had the report reference to that you spoke of?&mdash;The
report respecting this transaction.</p>
<p>What answer did Patrick make to that?&nbsp; What did Patrick
say to you when you put the question, as to what Church had said
respecting the report?&mdash;I said to Mr. Patrick, says I,
&ldquo;what did he say respecting the acknowledging the
report&rdquo;&mdash;that is, what did Mr. Church say to Mr.
Patrick about acknowledging the report that had gone abroad
respecting him.&nbsp; He said, &ldquo;It was false.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Do you mean that Church said it was false?&mdash;I mean that
Patrick said that the report was false.</p>
<p>By Lord <span class="smcap">Ellenborough</span>.&mdash;That is
not the answer to the question put by the Gentleman.&nbsp; Did
Church say that it was false?&mdash;I never saw Church upon the
subject.</p>
<p>By the <span class="smcap">Common Serjeant</span>.&mdash;When
Patrick made you an answer, did you understand that answer to be,
that Church had said the report was false, or that Patrick
himself said the report was false?&mdash;Patrick himself.</p>
<p>Patrick himself said that the report was
false?&mdash;Certainly.</p>
<p>Did you then put any other question to Mr. Patrick?&mdash;I
did.</p>
<p>What other question did you put?&mdash;I said, what answer did
Mr. Church give respecting its having been reported that he was
in liquor&mdash;that he made an excuse that he was in liquor?</p>
<p>What answer did Mr. Patrick give to that?&mdash;He said it was
false.&nbsp; He said there had been a great deal of
exaggeration.</p>
<p>Did you after this put any question to Mr. Patrick, whether
he, Mr. Patrick, thought that Mr. Church was implicated in the
transaction or not?&nbsp; Did you put any such question to
him?</p>
<p>Lord <span class="smcap">Ellenborough</span>.&mdash;Did you
use those words, or words to the same effect?&mdash;No, I did not
I put these words to him&mdash;&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; says I,
&ldquo;you did nothing!&nbsp; Did Mr. Church acknowledge nothing
to you?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;No, Sir,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;he
did not.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then he said Mr. Church had not mentioned a
word about it.</p>
<p>Did you make any observation to him, or he to you?&mdash;I
don&rsquo;t recollect any thing in particular.&nbsp; I said, says
I, &ldquo;As <a name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
42</span>you can bring nothing against him, let us pray for him,
and if he had the least idea of such a thing; and as you say you
cannot bring any thing home to him, and can&rsquo;t prove any
thing, that is all we can do.&nbsp; Let us pray that he may not
be guilty of such sin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lord <span class="smcap">Ellenborough</span>.&mdash;Did you
say, pray for him, if he was under any such
temptation?&mdash;Yes; pray for him, if was under any such
temptation.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Common Serjeant</span>.&mdash;Did Mr.
Patrick after that deliver any opinion to you whether he thought
Church was implicated in the transaction or not?&mdash;No, he did
not.</p>
<p>Did you at any other time see him, and hear him say any thing
about this transaction?&mdash;No.</p>
<p>Did any thing more pass at this meeting than what you have
told us?&nbsp; No.&mdash;Yes, Sir.&nbsp; I ask pardon: I met him
in June last, coming over Waterloo-bridge.&nbsp; I did not at
first know him; and he spoke to me, and he said, &ldquo;My name
is Patrick.&rdquo;&nbsp; I said, &ldquo;Mr. Patrick, why what are
you doing with Mr. Church?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; says
I, &ldquo;I hear you have brought something else against him:
what is that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lord <span class="smcap">Ellenborough</span>.&mdash;There is
no contradiction of Mr. Patrick in this.&nbsp; He was not asked
to this (continuation of the answer).&nbsp; &ldquo;Why,&rdquo;
says he, &ldquo;Sir, I should not have done it, but that Mr.
Church has spoken more disrespectful things respecting Mrs.
Patrick.&rdquo;&nbsp; He said he should not have done it, but
that Mr. Church had said many disrespectful things of Mrs.
Patrick.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>Cross-examined by</i> Mr. <span
class="smcap">Marryatt</span>.</p>
<p>Was it the Sabbath after the 27th of September that you first
heard of this?&mdash;I believe it was.&nbsp; It was within two or
three days after.</p>
<p>I think we have learnt that upon the Thursday night Mr.
Patrick came home, and that on the Friday morning the boy
communicated to him what had happened.&nbsp; Now on the Saturday,
was not this matter currently talked of about Mr.
Church?&mdash;No, I believe not.</p>
<p>You mean that you heard of the report two or three days after
the thing happened?&mdash;Yes.</p>
<p>You then heard of the report?&mdash;Yes.</p>
<p>You told us that you were desirous that Mr. Patrick should
call on Mr. Church?&mdash;Yes.</p>
<p>Then he did so, at your desire?&mdash;Yes.</p>
<p>Did Mr. Patrick bring the boy to you, and offer to have him
brought face to face with Mr. Church?&mdash;I believe he did.</p>
<p>Mr. Patrick said the boy was outside?&mdash;Mr. Patrick called
<a name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 43</span>at my
house in the course of the morning, and he sent him, and he said
the boy was outside.</p>
<p>Did he wish you to see the boy?&mdash;Not particularly, I
believe.</p>
<p>For what purpose did he bring the boy?&mdash;To go to Mr.
Church&rsquo;s?&mdash;I supposed so.</p>
<p>To go with you or with him, or with both of you to Mr.
Church&rsquo;s?&mdash;I was to go with him, and therefore the boy
followed.</p>
<p>Did the boy go with him into Mr. Church&rsquo;s
house?&mdash;He staid outside the door.&nbsp; He walked on the
other side of the way, opposite to where I was.</p>
<p>But he waited whilst you waited?&mdash;Yes: we both waited
outside.</p>
<p>Ready to go in to Mr. Church&rsquo;s when you were
wanted?&mdash;Yes: Mr. Patrick was to go in and hear what Mr.
Church had to say; and then we were to go in, too.</p>
<p>And he took the boy with him, in order that he might be taken
in and see Mr. Church face to face?&mdash;He brought the boy with
him, and I suppose that was his intention.</p>
<p>Did you decline introducing the boy to Mr. Church?&mdash;I had
no particular acquaintance with Mr. Church?&mdash;I was only one
of his hearers, and I thought it would be too great a liberty for
me to go to him.&nbsp; Mr. Patrick wanted me to go in alone to
Mr. Church, first.</p>
<p>Did he not invite you to take the boy in with you?&mdash;He
said nothing about that; I don&rsquo;t recollect any thing that
he did.</p>
<p>Why did you tell me, then, that you supposed the purpose of
bringing the boy was that he should be introduced to Mr.
Church?&mdash;No doubt about that.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know any
other reason he had than that, for bringing the boy.</p>
<p>Did he say so?&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know that he said that that
was his reason.&nbsp; He said he had the boy there.</p>
<p>Do you remember your declining to go in with Mr. Patrick to
Mr. Church&rsquo;s?&mdash;I told him I had no particular interest
in the business.&nbsp; I had no intimacy with Mr. Church, except
hearing him.&nbsp; I thought I had no business to be interested
in the knowledge of the fact, being only a hearer.&nbsp; I
thought therefore that my visit would be obtrusive.</p>
<p>Because you had no particular interest in the
business?&mdash;Why, I certainly had no interest in it.</p>
<p>And therefore you declined going in and taking the boy with
you?&mdash;I saw no necessity of so doing, as he did not
acknowledge himself guilty of any thing bad.</p>
<p>By Lord <span class="smcap">Ellenborough</span>.&nbsp; But the
boy being there, had you not the curiosity to examine the
boy?&mdash;I did not, it being delicate subject.</p>
<p><a name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 44</span>Did you
not think it important to come at the truth upon the subject, as
the boy was there and you might have examined him
yourself?&mdash;If Mr. Church had confessed any thing, I should
have thought it my duty to take the boy and have them face to
face.</p>
<p>But I should have thought that the circumstance of his not
confessing would be the reason why you would take them face to
face; or else why should you take the boy at all.&nbsp; But Mr.
Church not having confessed any thing, you therefore would not
examine the boy.&mdash;Was that your reason for not examining the
boy?&mdash;Yes, my Lord.</p>
<p>By Mr. <span class="smcap">Bolland</span>.&mdash;But if he
confessed any thing, you would have taken the boy to have them
face to face?&mdash;Yes.</p>
<p>Your object was to take the boy and have them face to face, if
Mr. Church acknowledged the crime?&mdash;Yes.</p>
<p>But surely when you found that Mr. Church had acknowledged his
fault, then there would be no reason for taking the boy to have
them face to face?&mdash;I should have thought it proper to take
the boy in, if Mr. Church acknowledged his crime.&nbsp; I wished
the boy in fact to come in with us; but when Mr. Patrick came out
and said that Mr. Church did not acknowledge any thing of it, I
did not think it necessary to have them face to face.</p>
<p>Then you did not think it right to have the boy in?&mdash;I
never spoke to the boy.</p>
<p>You never asked the boy about this transaction?&mdash;No.</p>
<p>Mr. Patrick never gave any opinion whether Mr. Church was
implicated in the transaction; but in answer to a particular part
of the transaction, he said that Mr. Church asserted that it was
false?&mdash;Yes.</p>
<p>Did you see the letter sent to Mrs. Hunter?&mdash;No.</p>
<p>I mean the letter about the three points of the boy&rsquo;s
statement which Mr. Church said he was able to
contradict?&mdash;No.</p>

<p>Were you present at the examination of Mr. Church before the
Magistrate?&mdash;I was.</p>
<p>What are you?&mdash;A hatter, near the Elephant and Castle, in
St. George&rsquo;s Fields.</p>
<p>Lord <span class="smcap">Ellenborough</span>.&mdash;Did you
take the testimony of the witnesses down in
writing?&mdash;No.</p>
<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gurney</span>.&mdash;Did Foreman, the
boy, in the account he gave before the Magistrate, say for what
purpose he searched the house?&mdash;He said that he went out to
the Potter and told the Potter that there were thieves in the
house, and that the Potter and he came to search the house.&nbsp;
He was asked a question by Mr. Sellon, whether or no he searched
the room where Mr. Church slept.&nbsp; He said, No, he did <a
name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 46</span>not search
that room.&nbsp; Mr. Sellon said, &ldquo;Why not search that
room?&rdquo;</p>
<p>What answer did he give to that?&mdash;The answer he gave was
that the Potter wished to break the door open.&nbsp; Mr. Sellon
said, &ldquo;Did you try the door to see whether it was open,
before the Potter talked of breaking it open?&rdquo;&nbsp; He
said, No: he did not wish to disturb his mistress.</p>
<p>Whilst the Potter was examined, did he say what was the alarm
that Foreman gave to him; did he say what was the alarm?&mdash;I
cannot charge my memory as to that.</p>
<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gurney</span>.&mdash;My Lord, this is
the case of the Defendant.</p>
<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Marryatt</span> then replied to the
Defendant&rsquo;s case, as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>May it please your Lordship, Gentlemen of the Jury&mdash;My
learned Friend has almost admitted the case on the part of the
Prosecution, in the nature of his address to you, by saying, in
effect, that if you believed Mr. Church to have gone into the
boy&rsquo;s chamber at that unseasonable hour of the morning, he
could hardly come there for any purpose but that ascribed to him
by this Indictment.&nbsp; At least, if my Learned Friend did not
make that confession in terms so explicitly as I have given them,
certainly he has not offered in his address to you the smallest
explanation of so very suspicious a purpose.&nbsp; And although I
invited him, when I first had the opportunity of stating this
case, to assign any possible reason, except that which is imputed
to the Defendant as matter of crime, why he should be in the
Boy&rsquo;s room under such circumstances, we have had no motive
assigned, nor any suggestion of apology or excuse offered for
such conduct.</p>
<p>There is an improbability in this case it is contended;
because there had been no overture of the same description made
to the lad before this period, nor any circumstance, by which an
indication of the Defendant&rsquo;s unnatural propensities, prior
to this transaction, could be inferred.&nbsp; Gentlemen, we have
lived some time in the world, and we have seen that men, with
these diabolical passions, make those overtures, not
unfrequently, to persons they never saw in the whole course of
their lives, until some occasional meeting&mdash;sometimes in the
Parks&mdash;nay, sometimes, even at public assemblies; and yet so
extraordinary is the phrenzy with which men of these propensities
are hurried, there is no accounting for their conduct on these
occasions: certainly there is no amounting for the conduct of
this Defendant in going into the boy&rsquo;s chamber, except that
which his abominable and unnatural lusts can suggest, and which
are imputed to him by this indictment.&nbsp; Gentlemen, <a
name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 47</span>in the first
place, was he there?&nbsp; Why it is suggested that the
boy&rsquo;s fright had magnified the powers of his vision, and
that he must have mistaken the Defendant for his mistress, or for
the maid servant, who slept with his sister.&nbsp; Now,
Gentlemen, we have it in evidence that Mr. Church is a man near
six feet high: a man of considerable size, and distinguishable
from the boy&rsquo;s mistress, who is a little feminate figure;
and also very distinguishable from the maid servant, whom my
learned friend, Mr. Gurney, wishes you to infer was the person
who entered the prosecutor&rsquo;s room, because the maid&rsquo;s
chamber door was not shut; although there was no question asked
by the Defendant&rsquo;s Counsel, as to the intimacy of this
young man with that servant maid.&nbsp; I admit that the
servant&rsquo;s door was not fast; but my Learned Friend did not
inquire whether the servant&rsquo;s door had been left open or
fastened, when the servants went to bed; nor was any inquiry made
whether the lock of that door was defective, as sometimes happens
to be the case with the servant&rsquo;s rooms in a
gentleman&rsquo;s house; for deficiencies of that description are
not so immediately remedied as in the more preferable rooms of
the house.&nbsp; Gentlemen, could the young man by any
possibility mistake the female figure of the maid servants or of
his mistress, for the man he described&mdash;a man that is of
considerable size&mdash;near six feet high, and a very striking
object in point of height?&nbsp; Most unquestionably there is no
pretence for supposing, that there could be any body else but Mr.
Church in the room at that time.&nbsp; Now what is the conduct of
the young lad on that occasion?&nbsp; He goes down to West, the
potter, immediately, and states to him, that Mr. Church had
behaved indecently.&nbsp; I admit that, in the course of
conversation, he mentioned some of the particulars of what
occurred, which the potter says he does not recollect.&nbsp; The
boy goes on further, and states particulars that he had related
to the man, which the latter says had not been mentioned to him;
and what is more probable, than that in giving an account of a
conversation which took place so long ago as the month of
September last, that the one may add half a sentence which the
other does not remember?&nbsp; But was not the statement that the
lad made at the time to the second witness, West, (though the
latter does not recollect the whole of what passed) that Church
came into his chamber, and conducted himself with indecency
towards him?&nbsp; They then return to the house; the lad and he
examine the house for the purpose of ascertaining whether any
body else is there; no other male person sleeping in the house;
and they find all secure and safe; and yet it is to supposed,
that they went in search for thieves!&nbsp; Why <a
name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 48</span>the result of
the search would decide whether the object of the search was to
see whether there were any thieves in the house&mdash;for neither
a door nor a window had been opened, nor was there any aperture
at which a thief could gain admittance.&nbsp; It is clear,
therefore, that there was no other male in the house except
Church, the party indicted; nor is there now any colour for
supposing that there was any body else there of his sex but
himself.&nbsp; But, it is said their object was to search for
thieves, and that the alarm was for thieves, and that the Boy,
when he went before the Magistrate, gave some account about
searching for thieves.&nbsp; Why, in his examination here to-day,
when he was asked whether he and West did not go back together to
the house and search for thieves, he very naturally said,
&ldquo;Yes, Sir:&rdquo; but why did he give that
answer?&mdash;Because there was another proposition put to him,
which appeared as material as that with respect to the search for
thieves, and accordingly he answered in the affirmative.&nbsp; It
is true that he did admit at first, that he went to search for
thieves; but when he came to give the explanation to the answer,
he states that he did not particularly search for thieves; and
after a little cross-examination by the same Learned Counsel, it
appeared that the object was not to search for thieves, but
merely to ascertain that there was no other man in the house that
could possibly commit this indecency, this outrage against
religion, morality, and nature.&nbsp; But the man who was called
last, named Wood, is called to state something that passed before
the Magistrate; and, according to his representation, there was
something said about going to search for thieves.&nbsp; It is
observable, however, that he did not take up the whole story told
in the testimony of the lad, nor did my Learned Friend examine
him as to the anterior part of his statement: and from this it
must fairly be inferred, that the most material part of the
boy&rsquo;s testimony given to-day, and that given before the
Magistrate, was consistent, and not to be shaken.&nbsp; For you
may be quite certain, Gentlemen, that when my Learned Friends on
the other side content themselves with catching at the smallest
variance in the testimony of the witness from his original
statement; it is a decided proof that the most important part of
the case is not to be shaken, and is incapable of
contradiction.&nbsp; The material part of the evidence remains
untouched by any shadow of doubt as to its credibility.&nbsp; My
Learned Friend rests satisfied with the contradiction upon the
subject of what passed between the Potter and the Boy, but which,
I say, is wholly immaterial as it affects his credit; and the
only further objection he makes to his testimony is, that his
evidence of to-day does not correspond, in some minute <a
name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 49</span>particular,
with his examination before the Magistrate.&nbsp; For the
reasons, however, which I have given you, Gentlemen, you will
dismiss these trifling matters from your serious
consideration.</p>
<p>But it seems that Mr. Patrick has been guilty of some
mis-statement as to what occurred in the early stage of this
proceeding; and we have Mr. Thomas called, as it is said, for the
purpose of contradicting him, as to the result of some
conversation which passed between them after the interview at Mr.
Church&rsquo;s house.&nbsp; Gentlemen, it is some what singular
that Mr. Thomas, who was one of the Defendant&rsquo;s hearers,
and interested himself so much in this case, that when the boy is
brought to give him information as to the complaint which he had
to make against Mr. Church, he does not make the least inquiry
into the lad&rsquo;s account of the transaction, nor does he
express any desire that the lad should be introduced to Mr.
Church.&nbsp; We have it in evidence from himself, that on the
day when Mr. Patrick called upon Mr. Church, he waited with the
lad on the outside of the house; and although Mr. Patrick brought
the boy for the express purpose of having him confronted face to
face with the Defendant, still Mr. Thomas does not ask a single
question of the lad, nor does he go into any examination upon the
subject.</p>
<p>Gentlemen, that this case was immediately blazoned about very
early is clear, though it was not carried before the magistrate
so soon; because we find that when Mr. Patrick came home on the
Thursday night, though he did not speak to the boy until the next
day, the Friday, yet the subject was generally mentioned to his
wife before he returned, and therefore the matter might have got
wind before it was fully explained by the boy to his master on
the Friday morning.&nbsp; It is quite clear that it was known to
the congregation on the following sabbath, and according to that
letter which has been read to you, (upon which I make no
comments, except so far as it bears on Mr. Patrick&rsquo;s
testimony), the Defendant, Mr. Church, had written on the 6th of
October to Mrs. Hunter, Mrs. Hunter having previously written to
him on the subject, for he begins by referring to the letter
which Mrs. Hunter had addressed to and expresses regret that he
shall lose her as a hearer in future: so that Mrs. Hunter
therefore, amongst other persons, was acquainted with the
rumours, because from him this letter comes, from which it
appears that she had written to him before; for it begins by
stating&mdash;&ldquo;My heart is already too much affected: your
letter only added affliction to my bonds.&rdquo;&mdash;Gentlemen,
I only dwell upon this circumstance in confirmation of Mr.
Patrick&rsquo;s statement, <a name="page50"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 50</span>that Mr. Church could contradict, not
the whole of the report, but three points of the boy&rsquo;s
statement.&nbsp; This letter having come to the knowledge of Mr.
Patrick, in which these three points are alluded to, and being
desired by some of the congregation to pay the Defendant a visit,
he accordingly resolves to call upon him.&nbsp; On that occasion
he introduces himself by stating, as the apology for his calling,
that he had seen a letter from the Defendant, in which he stated
that he could contradict certain points of the boy&rsquo;s
story.&nbsp; The Defendant you will observe does not contradict
the fact of his having written such a letter, but he goes into an
explanation with the witness as to what are the points of
contradiction; and then he states that so far as his having laid
hold of the boy, and his having told the lad that the person who
addressed him was his mistress, the whole was a mis-statement;
and these, Gentlemen, are the only points of denial upon which
the Defendant rested in his interview with Mr. Patrick, to whom,
however, he admitted distinctly that he was in the boy&rsquo;s
chamber, though he denies the subsequent part of the transaction,
which the boy to-day has solemnly sworn to have taken place.</p>
<p>Now, gentlemen, I ask again, if he was in the boy&rsquo;s
chamber, for what reason or proper purpose could he by
possibility go there?&nbsp; And if he was in that room, can you
have any doubt of the truth of all the circumstances which the
boy has positively sworn?&mdash;If it was a person of the male
sex who entered that apartment, it must clearly have been the
defendant; for there was no other man in the house.&nbsp; It
appearing distinctly that Mr. Patrick was absent from home on
that night.&nbsp; Then I ask you, whether there is any ground for
disbelieving the boy&rsquo;s story, who, immediately after the
disgusting scene he has described, goes to the pottery, tells his
story to the workman, and stays there the remainder of the night,
chusing rather to lose his rest than stay in the house with Mr.
Church, under the liability of a further encounter for the same
detestable purpose.&nbsp; The reason which the boy has given for
not alarming the house, is not an unnatural one.&nbsp; We have it
in evidence that Mr. West, feeling a manly indignation at what
had happened, manifested a disposition to pull the unnatural
offender out of his bed, and turn him into the street.&nbsp; But
the boy, apprehensive that such an occurrence might give an alarm
to his mistress, persuaded the potter to abstain from his
purpose, and they accordingly did not enter the defendant&rsquo;s
door.</p>
<p>Thus, gentlemen, the testimony of the prosecutor is consistent
in all its parts; for although Church denied some circumstances
of the transaction as stated in his letter read <a
name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 51</span>to-day, yet
every main and important feature of the transaction is confirmed
by collateral circumstances.&nbsp; Mr. Patrick&rsquo;s evidence
is a direct corroboration of the boy&rsquo;s story, from the
moment that the transaction first took place down to his
examination of to-day.&nbsp; But if, gentlemen, as I said before,
you feel any reasonable doubt of the purpose for which the
defendant came into the boy&rsquo;s room, it is your duty to
acquit him; but, on the other hand, if all the circumstances of
the case conspire to imprint upon your mind that the defendant
had clearly no other purpose, but a guilty and unnatural one when
he entered that apartment, it is your bounden duty, disgusting as
it may be, to pronounce a sentence of condemnation, whatever
consequences may result to the defendant in the judgment which he
shall hereafter receive.</p>
<h3>THE CHARGE.</h3>
<p>Lord Ellenborough delivered his charge to the jury as
follows:</p>
<p>Gentlemen of the Jury&mdash;This is an indictment against John
Church for an assault upon the person of Adam Foreman, with
intent to commit an unnatural crime with him.&nbsp; There has
been a considerable body of evidence laid before you, against him
as well as for him: and it is for you to say in the result, after
giving that evidence due consideration, whether the defendant has
committed the assault with intent to perpetrate the atrocious
crime imputed to him by the indictment.</p>
<p>Now, assuming the fact to be that Mr. Church was in the room
at the time this offence was supposed to have been committed,
that alone imposes upon him the necessity of giving some
explanation for the occasion which brought him there.&nbsp; If,
in addition to the fact of being there, which he admits, himself,
to be true, you should believe the boy further in his statement
that such an overture was made to him, and that the hand of a man
was put upon his private parts in bed, you will have to say with
what other purpose than as an inducement to the commission of an
unnatural crime, it had been placed there.&nbsp; That is,
supposing you believe the facts as stated by the young man.&nbsp;
I should apprehend that no reason can be suggested for such an
indecent intercourse (supposing it did take place) with this
man&rsquo;s person unless it was a prelude or inducement to the
committing of the crime imputed to the defendant.&nbsp; Now the
main question for your consideration will be, whether that which
is sworn by Foreman, and confirmed by Mr. Patrick, is truly
sworn.&nbsp; I think too much stress has been laid upon the
circumstance, <a name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
52</span>stated about the searching for thieves, which it is
said, on the part of the defendant, was the avowed object of
Foreman in returning to the house.&nbsp; It was very natural and
highly probable when he apprehended, if he did truly apprehend,
that a male person had come into his room and had accosted him in
the manner he stated, that he should be clearly satisfied before
he went farther in communicating to the potter the indecencies
offered to his person, that there was no other male in the house,
and seeing that no other male could come into the house at that
time of night, unless he came for this purpose and no
other.&nbsp; In this point of view, I think it is not at all
unnatural or improbable in his conduct, even if he had said that
he had gone in search for thieves; and, if you recollect, his
evidence was, &ldquo;that he had searched the house, not for
thieves in particular, but to see if there was any body in any of
the rooms.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I did not think of thieves,&rdquo;
says he, &ldquo;because I knew who it was,&rdquo; and so
on.&nbsp; He now says, that at that time he knew it was Mr.
Church, and therefore he did not think of searching for thieves,
his object being, in searching the house, to ascertain whether
there was any other male in the house besides the one to whom he
attaches the crime imputed by this indictment.</p>
<p>Gentleman, I shall now proceed to state to you the evidence as
it has been given on both sides.</p>
<p>Adam Foreman, the first witness, states, that he shall be
twenty years of age the first day of December next.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I am an apprentice to, Mr. Patrick, the potter, of
Vauxhall; I have been with him about five years.&nbsp; I have
known the defendant, John Church, by sight about two or three
years.&nbsp; He is a preacher, and I have attended as one of the
congregation in the chapel where he preaches; I have often seen
him.&nbsp; I sleep generally at my father&rsquo;s house, but when
my master goes out of town I sleep at his house.&nbsp; The
defendant Church lives near his chapel in St. George&rsquo;s
Fields.&nbsp; The defendant came to sleep at my master&rsquo;s on
the 25th of September last.&rdquo;&nbsp; It seems, Gentlemen, he
came there by invitation from Mr. Patrick, having weak health,
and it being more convenient for him to sleep in better
air.&nbsp; &ldquo;He slept there on the night of the 25th
September; I slept there also, that night.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t
know whether the defendant had been there before; I cannot say
whether I had seen him there before.&nbsp; My master was out of
town that night, but where I cannot say.&nbsp; The persons who
slept in the house that night were Mr. Church, my mistress, the
children, and the two maid-servants; there was no other man in
the house except Church and myself.&nbsp; My bed-room was the
front parlour on the first floor, over the kitchen.&nbsp; It <a
name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 53</span>was not
usually a bed-room, but I slept there because there was no other
bed-room that I could sleep in.&nbsp; A temporary bed was put up
there for me.&nbsp; I went to bed at near one
o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; There was a kiln burning, and I was obliged
to sit up to let the man in to the kiln when he came.&nbsp; It
was necessary for me to sit up to attend that kiln, and to give
the man the key.&nbsp; That man&rsquo;s name is Thomas
West.&nbsp; I went to sleep directly I went to bed.&nbsp; I had
not been asleep more than half an hour, before I was awoke by
some one putting his hands under the bed clothes, and laying hold
of my private parts.&nbsp; He laid hold of me very tight.&nbsp; I
put my hand out of the bed clothes and caught hold of him, and
asked him who he was.&nbsp; I said, who are you?&nbsp; I laid
hold of him, as near as I can guess, by the upper part of the
arm; and I felt lower down, and found by the sleeve that he had
got a man&rsquo;s shirt on.&nbsp; I had a hold of him by the
upper part of the arm, and running my hand down to the wrist, I
found he had a man&rsquo;s shirt on.&nbsp; The wrist was
buttoned.&nbsp; I knew very well it was man, because he had got a
man&rsquo;s shirt on.&nbsp; The person, whoever it was, said, in
a feint voice like a woman, &ldquo;Adam, don&rsquo;t you know
me?&nbsp; I am your mistress.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was not Mrs.
Patrick&rsquo;s voice.&nbsp; I knew the voice directly I heard it
to be Mr. Church&rsquo;s.&nbsp; He fled from the room directly;
he went out of the room in a hurried step.&nbsp; I got out of bed
and put on my small clothes and shoes, and went out to the
door.&nbsp; As the man opened the door, I saw by the lamp that it
was Mr. Church, and he had only his shirt on.&nbsp; The lamp is
outside of the street door, on the Terrace, and throws a light
through the fan-light of the hall door.&nbsp; It is a parish
lamp.&nbsp; At the time I saw Church by the light of the lamp I
was sitting up in bed: I had not then left my bed.&nbsp; I saw
that the person who went out through the door had a man&rsquo;s
shirt on.&nbsp; I did not see his face at all; his back was to
me.&nbsp; I then got up and put my small-clothes on and shoes,
and went to the pottery to get the man to come up to the
house.&nbsp; I told Thomas West what had happened.&nbsp; He was
in the pottery, and was there I before went to bed.&nbsp; The
person who went out at the door shut it after him.&nbsp; I saw
him by the light of the lamp when he opened the door.&nbsp; There
was no light in the room; the light came from a lamp on the
terrace.&nbsp; That lamp is about five or six yards from the door
of the house on the terrace.&nbsp; The terrace, on which my
master&rsquo;s house is situated, is a row of houses raised above
the road.&nbsp; The lamp is upon the terrace opposite to the
door.&nbsp; The light from the lamp is given to the passage
through the fan-light over the door.&nbsp; When the man opened
the door and went out, I saw him by the light from the
lamp.&nbsp; I could not see the <a name="page54"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 54</span>face of the person, but I saw that he
had a shirt on.&nbsp; I was rather alarmed.&nbsp; It all took
place in a minute.&nbsp; It was not long about.&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t know how long he had been there before I awoke.&nbsp;
From the moment I awoke it took place as fast as possible.&nbsp;
I immediately went to West.&nbsp; We did not know whether any
body had got in or not.&nbsp; West and I directly came and
searched the house for thieves.&nbsp; We went and looked at every
chamber door in the home except Mr. Church&rsquo;s and my
mistress&rsquo;s.&nbsp; We looked at the door of Mr. Church, and
that of my mistress.&nbsp; They were both shut.&nbsp; We found
all the doors in the house shut except the servant&rsquo;s, which
we found on the jar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now, Gentlemen, great stress is laid by the learned counsel
for the Defendant upon this circumstance.&nbsp; It is suggested
that it might be Mrs. Patrick, or one of the maid servants who
entered the room.&nbsp; It appears that one of the servants was
the prosecutor&rsquo;s own sister, and it was not likely to be
her that went in.&nbsp; It is said the prosecutor&rsquo;s counsel
ought to have called the maid servant and Mrs. Patrick to
negative the supposed circumstance of their having gone into the
room.&nbsp; Now, this observation is to be made, that it was open
to the one side or to the other to have called the maid servant,
and have proposed that question to her.&nbsp; It was clearly open
to the Defendant, if he chose to call the maid, and to have asked
her that question; and it was equally open to the counsel for the
prosecution.&nbsp; It was also open to both sides to have called
Mrs. Patrick.&nbsp; It is probable that the prosecutor&rsquo;s
counsel did not like to expose her to the pain of an unnecessary
examination, because the Defendant might have called her as a
witness for himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I went and told West that Mr. Church came down into my
room, and behaved in a very indecent manner.&nbsp; I told him
that Church had been there and laid hold of my private
parts.&nbsp; I did not search the house for thieves in
particular, but to search if any body was in any of the
rooms.&nbsp; We searched the house.&nbsp; We looked all over it
to see if there was anybody in any of the rooms.&nbsp; We
searched the house, but not for thieves in particular.&nbsp; I
did not think of thieves, because I knew who it was.&nbsp; We did
not go into the maid servant&rsquo;s room; we only looked
in.&nbsp; We found the door open and looked in.&nbsp; The maids
were in bed.&nbsp; One was my sister.&nbsp; The door being a-jar,
we pushed a little, and we saw that they were a-bed.&nbsp; We did
not speak to them.&nbsp; We did not search the house for thieves,
because I knew who the person was.&nbsp; The reason of my
searching the house was because I wished to be quite right before
I made the accusation against Mr. Church.&nbsp; <a
name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 55</span>We found that
there was no other man in the house but Mr. Church.&nbsp; There
was no door, no window open, at which any other man could have
come in.&nbsp; The light from the Terrace came through the
fan-light over the door.&nbsp; The lamp gives a pretty fair light
to the hall, and shews a little light up the stairs.&nbsp; The
time when the person opened the door and went out, was the time
that I got a view of his person.&nbsp; I did not hear him when he
first came into the room.&nbsp; I was awakened by the application
of his hand to my person.&nbsp; He was standing by the bed-side
on the floor.&nbsp; I did not call to him by name, or give him to
understand that I knew who he was.&nbsp; I did not see any part
of his face, but I saw his back as he went out of the room.&nbsp;
He was a person that appeared to be the height of Mr.
Church.&nbsp; I cannot say what height he is.&nbsp; I cannot say
exactly whether he had a night-cap on.&nbsp; I think it was a
handkerchief tied round his head.&nbsp; I could not tell what
sort of a handkerchief it was, whether coloured or
not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He does not say positively whether it was a light or a
coloured handkerchief, but he says he could not tell.&nbsp; He
did not see whether it was coloured or not.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We went to Church&rsquo;s door, but we did not touch
it, nor did we go in.&nbsp; West wanted to go into the room and
pull him out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That is confirmed by the testimony of West himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I objected to West&rsquo;s pulling him out, because I
was afraid of disturbing my mistress.&nbsp; She would have been
very much alarmed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That was the account he gave in his original examination
before the magistrate, as the reason for his not going into the
room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Church never had any conversation with me, nor did he
ever make any overture of this sort to me before this time.&nbsp;
There was nothing particular in his manner or in his conduct
towards me before this time.&nbsp; I have never spoken to him at
all since.&nbsp; I saw him attend before the magistrate.&nbsp;
There I spoke in his presence, but not immediately to him.&nbsp;
I did not hear him speak before the magistrate.&nbsp; I have
given the same account before the magistrate that I have now done
here.&nbsp; I know no other circumstances from which I could
collect that it was a man.&nbsp; The hand was withdrawn when I
awoke.&nbsp; By the height of the person I saw, I could ascertain
whether it was or was not the height of my mistress or any of the
female part of the house.&nbsp; Mr. Church was a great deal
bigger than any body there.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t think he is quite
six foot.&nbsp; He is a tall and stout man.&nbsp; There was light
enough by the lamp to see the outline of the man, so as to be
able to say that he was a tall person.&nbsp; Mrs. Patrick <a
name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 56</span>is quite a
little woman, she is quite different person from the person I saw
in the room.&nbsp; I am quite clear of that.&nbsp; The maid who
slept in the room with my sister, is about as tall as I am; not
quite so tall.&nbsp; I am quite sure it was not her.&nbsp; There
was no other maid in the house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is the evidence of the first witness; and you observe he
says, he is quite sure it was not any of the females of the house
who came into his room; and he is quite sure that there was no
other male person in the house besides himself and the Defendant
Church; and he is certain that it was not the maid nor his
mistress.</p>
<p>The next witness examined is Thomas West.&nbsp; He says,
&ldquo;I am workmen to Mr. Patrick, the potter.&nbsp; On the
morning of the 26th of September last, I relieved Adam Foreman at
the Kiln.&nbsp; I relieved him about half past twelve
o&rsquo;clock in the morning: he left me shortly afterwards for
the purpose of going to bed.&nbsp; I saw him again in about half
an hour.&nbsp; He was only part dressed.&nbsp; He had his small
clothes, his shoes, and one stocking on.&nbsp; He came to me in a
very great fright, and bid me light my candle.&nbsp; He appeared
very much alarmed, and bid me light my candle and come along with
him up to the house.&nbsp; He told me, as we were going along the
garden, that Mr. Church had been to him, and behaved in a very
indecent manner.&nbsp; He did not explain how.&nbsp; He unlocked
the door, and we went into the house together.&nbsp; When we got
into the house he put the remainder of his clothes on.&nbsp; We
then went and searched every room in the house, beginning at the
bottom and going upwards to the top, except my mistress&rsquo;s
room and Mr. Church&rsquo;s.&nbsp; We went into all the rooms
except Mr. Church&rsquo;s and Mrs. Patrick&rsquo;s.&nbsp; We did
not go into Mr. Church&rsquo;s room or that of my mistress.&nbsp;
We did not open the door of either of those two rooms.&nbsp; When
we came to Mr. Church&rsquo;s door, I said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go
and pull him out; shall I?&rdquo;&nbsp; The Lad said, &ldquo;No,
for fear of disturbing my mistress.&rdquo;&nbsp; In consequence
of that observation of the lad&rsquo;s, I forebore going into the
room.&nbsp; Foreman then came along with me into the
Pottery.&nbsp; He came down stairs; locked the back door, and
staid with me the whole of the remainder of the night at the
Pottery &rsquo;till the morning.&nbsp; We searched in all the
rooms of the house for the purpose of seeing if there was any
other person in the place.&nbsp; We found no window or door open
at which any body could have got into the house.&nbsp; I saw them
all secure and fastened.&nbsp; When Foreman came to me, he did
not explain what Church had done to him; he only told me that
Church had behaved in a very indecent manner to him.&nbsp; I did
go to search for thieves in the house.&nbsp; When he told me that
Church had behaved in a very indecent manner to him, <a
name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 57</span>I went to see
if there was any other person in the place.&nbsp; Foreman did not
tell me he believed that there was thieves in the house.&nbsp; I
am quite sure he did not explain in what way Church behaved to
him.&nbsp; He did not tell me that Church came to his bed side,
and laid his hand upon his private parts; he never from first to
the last, either in the course of the morning when staying with
me, or after we had been to the house, tell me what Church had
done, and that he had laid his hand upon his private parts.&nbsp;
I went before the Magistrate some time after this; I believe it
was six or seven weeks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gentlemen, there would be a great deal in the observation upon
the circumstance of the parties not going before the Magistrate
until six or seven weeks afterwards, if the matter had been kept
a secret.&nbsp; But it is not kept a secret; so far from that, it
was quite notorious.&nbsp; And here is a letter, in the
hand-writing of the Defendant himself, dated the 6th of October,
in answer to a letter of Mrs. Hunter; and it appears that the
subject had been ventilated and circulated, for some days before,
and had become the topic of general discussion amongst the
Defendant&rsquo;s congregation; because it appears that Mrs.
Hunter had written a letter herself to the Defendant upon
it.&nbsp; There is nothing, therefore, in the observation of the
Learned Counsel for the Defendant as to the tardiness of going
before the Magistrate.</p>
<p>He says, &ldquo;The Lad then went with his father.&nbsp; The
Lad generally slept at home at his father&rsquo;s house.&nbsp;
The father lives about a quarter of a mile from Mr.
Patrick&rsquo;s.&nbsp; The Boy did not sleep at his
father&rsquo;s the next night; but he did the next night after
that.&nbsp; We did not go to the Justices until about six or
seven weeks afterwards.&nbsp; I did not communicate with Mr.
Patrick upon the subject before I went to the Justice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next witness called is Mr. Patrick.&nbsp; He says, I am a
Potter, at Vauxhall; the boy, Foreman, lived with me all the time
I have been in the pottery business; that is, between five and
six years.&nbsp; He slept in my house only occasionally, and that
was whenever I went out of town.&nbsp; As there was no other male
in the house on those occasions, he used to sleep there for the
purpose of giving the key to the Potter in the morning.&nbsp; I
was absent from home on the 25th of September; and on that
occasion the Boy slept in my house; he slept upon a chair bed in
the front parlour; it was a temporary bed for a nurse
occasionally.&nbsp; I knew the Defendant, John Church; I first
became acquainted with him when I came to reside at Vauxhall; he
is a Baptist Preacher, and I attended his chapel; and that was
the way I became acquainted with him.&nbsp; His residence is
adjoining <a name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
58</span>to the Chapel.&nbsp; In the month of September, the
Defendant came to sleep at my house.&nbsp; He complained
occasionally of ill health; and thinking that he was ill, I asked
him, out of friendship, to take a bed at my house, as I thought
the air would be of service to him.&nbsp; I returned home on the
evening of the 26th of September, and on the morning of the 27th
the Boy made a communication to me respecting this
transaction.</p>
<p>So that you see, Gentlemen, the Boy makes this communication
to his master at the earliest moment he has an opportunity of
speaking to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Several of the congregation afterwards applied to me,
and at their request I went to Mr. Church on the 9th of
October.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But, Gentlemen, the 9th of October is not the first time that
this matter was mentioned; for it appears to have been in
circulation at the time that Mr. Church wrote the letter which
has been given in evidence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was the first communication I had with Mr. Church
on the subject.&nbsp; Church said he took it extremely kind of me
in calling upon him.&nbsp; I said he might take it as he pleased,
as I did not come willingly, but that some of his congregation
thought that I ought to see him on the business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>You observe, Gentlemen, that it was at the request of some of
the congregation that he went; and, in a subsequent part of the
evidence, it appears that Mr. Thomas, one of the congregation,
had expressly desired him to call upon the Defendant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told him, I waited upon him, having seen a letter,
wherein he denied three particular points in the Boy&rsquo;s
statement.&nbsp; He then denied, in the fleet place, having taken
hold of the Boy, and in the second, his having said to the Boy
that he was his mistress.&nbsp; The third point I didn&rsquo;t
particularly recollect; but in the course of conversation he
admitted that he had been in the Boy&rsquo;s room.&nbsp; He
denied that he had had hold of the Boy, and that he had told the
Boy that he was his mistress.&nbsp; I told him that of these two
points the Boy was positive, and I had no reason to doubt any
thing that he said.&nbsp; The Defendant said &lsquo;that he was
very sorry for it; the worst of it was, it confirmed ancient
reports.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gentlemen, this is the language of Church himself.&nbsp; What
those antient reports were we have not heard; we are only left to
guess at what the expression alluded to.</p>
<p>Upon which Mr. Patrick said, &ldquo;It did so, and of
course,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;I told him that I should believe
all that I had heard heretofore: and I wished him a good
morning.&nbsp; I have never spoken to him since; but I have seen
him.&mdash;<a name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
59</span>This is an exact copy of the letter dated the 6th of
October, addressed to Mrs. Hunter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gentlemen, this letter is afterwards read in evidence.&nbsp;
Mrs. Hunter being called as a witness, she stated that she
believed, from the knowledge that she had of the character of the
Defendant&rsquo;s hand-writing, she believes the original from
which this copy is taken, was written by him; and Mr. Patrick
swears that the letter from which he took this copy was, in his
belief, in &ldquo;the hand-writing of the Defendant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now, Gentlemen, upon reading this letter, one is very much
struck, not by what it contains, absurd as it is in some
respects, and containing something like a profane use of the
sacred name of the Saviour, but at the absence of what one
certainly might naturally expect to find in the letter of a
person writing to a friend, and one of his own congregation, upon
this subject.&nbsp; What is so natural as that he should most
explicitly and peremptorily deny the whole accusation and charge,
and rest with confidence upon his own innocence and the character
which he bore amongst his congregation.&nbsp; But instead of
that, he envelopes the matter in a sanctified discussion, such as
has been read to you, dwelling upon the sacred name of our
Saviour in a very indecent manner.&nbsp; I shall read this letter
to you again; and if you find any thing in it which can be
construed into an express denial of the circumstances charged
against him, I am sure it will make a proper impression upon your
minds.&nbsp; I confess I can find no such denial.&nbsp; He says,
&ldquo;I am able to contradict three things&rdquo;&mdash;one of
which is laying hold of the boy&rsquo;s person, and the other the
speaking of his mistress.&nbsp; The third point, Mr. Patrick does
not recollect.&nbsp; But, you will observe, he did not deny being
in the room: that seems to be a fact now undisputed.&nbsp; The
letter is in these words:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: right"><i>Oct.</i> 6, 1816.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear Mrs. Hunter&mdash;My heart is already too much
affected.&nbsp; Your letter only added affliction to my bonds;
but I forbear.&nbsp; I would have called on you this morning, but
I was too low in mind to speak to any friend but Jesus.&nbsp;
There I am truly comfortable.&nbsp; Pardon me.&nbsp; But I make
no remarks on what you have been told.&nbsp; I must bear
it.&nbsp; Though I am able to contradict these things, I would
rather not.&nbsp; Mr. and Mrs. Patrick have always dealt kindly
to me.&nbsp; I am only grieved that dear Mrs. P. whom I really
love, that she should try to injure me in the estimation of those
who are real friends to my dear children.&nbsp; The thought
affects me, Why hurt my poor family?&nbsp; But I am too much
depressed to enlarge.&nbsp; I shall never forget their
kindness.&nbsp; God will reward them, as he has many who have
dealt well to me.&nbsp; But he will resent cruelty in those who
have and are still trying to degrade me.&nbsp; Mrs. P. will <a
name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 60</span>live to see
it.&nbsp; Dear Mrs. Hunter, I am grieved at heart.&nbsp; I can
not relieve your mind.&nbsp; I am truly sorry to lose you as a
hearer, because your soul has been blessed, and you know both the
plague of the heart and the value of Jesus.&nbsp; May he be
increasingly precious to you!&mdash;in his person, love, and
grave.&nbsp; Farewell, my dear kind friend.&nbsp; The Lord Jesus
will reward you for your love to me and kindness to mine.&nbsp;
God is not unrighteous to forget your work of faith and labour of
love.&nbsp; With many tears I write this.&nbsp; May we meet in
glory, when no enemy shall distress my mind, nor sin, nor death
shall part us more.&nbsp; I need not remind my dear friend that I
am a child of peculiar Providence.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is very extraordinary.&nbsp; Whether he considers himself
as privileged above the rest of mankind, I know not: but it
should seem that he does.&nbsp; He says:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I am a child of peculiar providence: and
that Heart of Eternal Love, and that Arm of Invincible Power, has
protected me&mdash;has called me to himself&mdash;and for every
act of straying, will correct me.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Therefore, he admits that he is subject to the punishment of
the Divine Being.&nbsp; Whether he is exempt from the temporal
jurisdiction for his crimes or not, seems to be a matter of doubt
with him: for he says,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;In every act of straying, God will correct
me with his own hand; but will resent every other hand sooner or
later.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So that he admits that for his offences, or his &ldquo;acts of
straying,&rdquo; as he is pleased to call them, God will punish
him with his own hand; but that no other hand will punish
him.&nbsp; The letter concludes&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;This you will live to see.&nbsp; Adieu,
dear friend: accept the starting tear, and the best wishes of an
heart sincere.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;Your&rsquo;s, truly,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;Till we shall meet
above.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Gentlemen, this is his letter.&nbsp; If it had been a full and
explicit denial of the whole charge, it would have been more
favourable to him.&nbsp; One is sorry to see the name of the
Divine Being mixed up with so indecent and abominable a
story.</p>
<p>Mr. Patrick goes on to state that he denied having had hold of
the boy, but he admitted that he was in the room; upon his saying
to the Defendant that as to the two points in question, the boy
was positive, and that he had no reason to doubt any thing that
the boy said, the defendant replied that he was sorry for it,
because it confirmed ancient reports.&nbsp; The witness said,
&ldquo;it did so;&rdquo; and he told him that he should now
believe all that he had heard heretofore, and he wished him a
good morning.&nbsp; He says, &ldquo;I <a name="page61"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 61</span>never saw him afterwards to speak to
him.&nbsp; This is an exact copy of the letter dated 6th October,
1816, addressed to Mrs. Hunter.&nbsp; I took an exact copy of it
myself.&nbsp; I did not read the copy of the letter to the
Defendant, for I had not the copy with me at that time.&nbsp;
With respect to the letter I told him that I wished to know what
the three things were that he could deny.&nbsp; I do not
recollect the third point; it is not material, he admitted being
in the room, but denied the laying hold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He is asked in what terms the Defendant admitted that he was
in the room, and he said the Defendant said, &ldquo;I was in the
room, but I did not lay hold of the boy.&rdquo;&nbsp; He did not
say why he was in the room.&nbsp; &ldquo;I returned the letter of
the 6th of October to Mrs. Hunter, from whom I received
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On his cross-examination he says:&mdash;&ldquo;I mean to say
that the Defendant said distinctly that he was in the room.&nbsp;
I never said to any person after I had seen Mr. Church that I
thought he was not implicated at all in the charge.&nbsp; I gave
a person named <i>Thomas</i> an account of the conversation I had
with the Defendant, but I never accompanied that account with the
observation &ldquo;he is not implicated&rdquo;&mdash;nor to any
person.&nbsp; Mr. Thomas went with me to Mr. Church&rsquo;s
house, but he did not go in.&nbsp; Mr. Thomas is not a friend of
mine.&nbsp; Mr. Thomas walked with me to the door.&nbsp; It was
his wife&rsquo;s wish and my wife&rsquo;s that I should make the
application to the Defendant.&nbsp; Mr. Thomas walked with me as
far as the door of the Defendant, but he did not go in.&nbsp;
After I came out from Mr. Church&rsquo;s I had some conversation
with Mr. Thomas, and I told him partly what had transpired.&nbsp;
It was very short what did transpire.&nbsp; I think I told Mr.
Thomas that the Defendant admitted his having been in the
boy&rsquo;s room, but I am not very positive as to that
point.&nbsp; I know I told him that Mr. Church said he did not
lay hold of him.&nbsp; I never made any such answer to Mr. Thomas
as that I thought Mr. Church was not at all
implicated&rdquo;&mdash;nor any thing conveying that
meaning.&nbsp; I never told him directly or indirectly that there
was nothing to implicate Mr. Church.&nbsp; I never told Mr.
Thomas or any other person that I would prosecute Mr. Church for
this crime, because he had said disrespectful things of my wife:
but I think I told Mr. I would prosecute the Defendant for the
defamation of my wife&rsquo;s character.&nbsp; But this was a
considerable time after the transaction in question.&nbsp; I
think I did inform Mr. Thomas that I would prosecute the
Defendant for the defamation of my wife&rsquo;s character.</p>
<p>The next witness called is Mrs. Hunter, and she says&mdash;<a
name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 62</span>&ldquo;I am
one of the congregation and a hearer of Mr. Church.&nbsp; I
received a letter, dated the 6th of October, but it had no name
subscribed to it.&nbsp; I cannot tell from whom it came.&nbsp; It
had no place of abode or signature, except the day of the
month.&nbsp; I put that letter into the hands of Mr. Patrick, at
least I gave it to Mr. Patrick&rsquo;s daughter, who gave it to
her father.&nbsp; That letter was returned to me, but I took no
further notice of it.&nbsp; After the letter was returned to me,
I put it into a drawer, and I do not know what is become of
it.&nbsp; I looked for it on the Thursday morning before I came
here, but I was unable to find it.&nbsp; I searched diligently
for it, but I could find no trace of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Under such circumstances, Gentlemen, the original letter
having been searched for, and not being to be found, that, in
point of law, lets in the copy of it, which could not be admitted
as evidence as it existed.&nbsp; She is then asked whether the
letter received was in the hand writing of Mr. Church? and she
says, &ldquo;I have seen his writing.&nbsp; I have seen him write
in different hands.&nbsp; He does not write always the
same.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t mean to say exactly that he wrote in
different hands; but there was such a difference in the same
hand-writing that one would hardly think it was the same.&nbsp; I
rather think that letter was in Mr. Church&rsquo;s hand-writing,
but I could not be positive as there was no name to it.&nbsp; I
cannot say positively whether it was or was not his
hand-writing.&nbsp; I believed then it was his hand-writing, and
I still believe the same.&nbsp; I did not communicate the letter
to any body but Mr. Patrick, and I told him that I had received a
letter from Mr. Church.&nbsp; The search I made for the letter
was last Thursday.&nbsp; I know nothing of it, and I have no
reason to believe that it is now in existence.&nbsp; I did not
leave a drawer or a place unsearched.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Patrick is again called, and says that he knew the hand
writing of the Defendant in October last.&nbsp; &ldquo;I copied
this letter from the letter I had from Mrs. Hunter.&nbsp; I
believe that the letter from which I made this copy was in Mr.
Church&rsquo;s hand writing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gentlemen you have had that letter read to you; and this is
the Case on the part of the Prosecution.</p>
<p>On the part of the Defendant, Gentlemen, it is observed as
matter of surprise that the Prosecutor&rsquo;s Counsel have not
called the female servant as a witness.&nbsp; It is very true she
was not called, but it was open to the Defendant to have called
her, and undoubtedly if his Counsel thought that any examination
of hers would have been beneficial to him, we must presume that
she would have been called.&nbsp; The Bed-room door of the
servants, it is observed, was ajar; and it is contended that one
of the servants might have been the person who went down stairs
to the young man&rsquo;s room: and it is further contended that
there was such a deficiency of light that it was impossible for
the Prosecutor to identify with certainty the <a
name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 63</span>person who
entered his apartment.&nbsp; Now whether there is any thing in
the observation as to the deficiency of the light, it for you to
judge; but this remark fairly arises from the circumstance of the
maid&rsquo;s Bed-room door being a-jar.&nbsp; It is most likely
that if either of them came out of the room for any improper
purpose, she would have shut the door after her: and it is to be
recollected that one of the servants was the Boy&rsquo;s own
Sister.&nbsp; It is observed likewise as matter of surprise, that
Mrs. Patrick is not called.&nbsp; Gentlemen, it would be very
disrespectful to Mrs. Patrick to put such a question to her, as
whether she offered these indecencies to the Boy; but if the
Defendant&rsquo;s Counsel thought that she could not have stood
that examination, as I have repeatedly told you, they might have
called her.</p>
<p>On the part of the defendant, they called Mr. Thomas, and he
says, &ldquo;I live in Prospect Place, West Square, St.
George&rsquo;s Fields.&nbsp; I am by business, an appraiser and
undertaker.&nbsp; I know the defendant Mr. Church.&nbsp; I was
one of his hearers.&nbsp; I was acquainted with Mr. Patrick, but
not until the report was made respecting Mr. Church.&nbsp; I
can&rsquo;t say that I have ever seen him attending Mr. Church,
as one of the congregation.&nbsp; I went with Mr. Patrick the day
he went to Mr. Church&rsquo;s house.&nbsp; It was the 9th of
October, a few days after the report.&nbsp; I did not go into the
house with him.&nbsp; I stood outside the door.&nbsp; I learned
from Mr. Patrick, that he was going to Mr. Church upon the
subject of this business.&nbsp; He told me he had a letter of Mr.
Church&rsquo;s, and was going to him to make inquiries.&nbsp; He
called upon me at my house too with him, and he told me he was
going upon the business of this inquiry.&nbsp; Indeed, it was at
my request that he should.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So that you see, Gentlemen, it was not the voluntary intrusion
of Mr. Patrick upon Mr. Church, when he went to his house; but it
is in compliance with the request of some of the
Congregation.&nbsp; He says &ldquo;Mrs. Thomas went to speak to
his wife, and it was at my wife&rsquo;s and his wife&rsquo;s
request that he went.&mdash;The interview with Mr. Church lasted
near an hour.&nbsp; It seemed to be a long while, not much less
than an hour, as near as I can guess the time.&nbsp; When he came
out I put some questions to him respecting what had passed
between him and Mr. Church:&mdash;I asked him what Mr. Church had
said? and he replied that Mr. Church did not say
anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now, Gentlemen, it is impossible that Church could have said
nothing, for it is not very likely that Mr. Patrick would be
occupied for an hour hearing himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He said Mr. Church seemed very much confounded on
account of the cause, but said noting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Certainly, Mr. Thomas, from the nature of things, must be
incorrect, for it is impossible that Mr. Patrick could be an hour
in conversation with Mr. Church, and that the latter should say
nothing.&nbsp; Mr. Patrick could not be an hour in conversation
with himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He said Mr. Church seemed very much confounded on
account of the cause.&nbsp; He (Patrick) seemed to insinuate that
it would be <a name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
64</span>injurious to the cause God.&nbsp; He did not say,
&ldquo;the cause,&rdquo; but I only suppose he meant the cause of
God.&nbsp; I asked whether Church had said any thing, and Patrick
said &ldquo;No.&rdquo;&nbsp; He said he seemed very much
confused.&nbsp; I said, what do you mean?&nbsp; If there is any
thing against the man, do you think I would not have been
faithful to him and have charged him with it?&nbsp; Mr. Patrick
said, he did not know any thing about that, and that he was not
the proper person.&nbsp; He said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
know,&mdash;I am not so proper as you.&rdquo;&nbsp; I said to
him, &ldquo;what did he say respecting the report?&rdquo;&nbsp;
He said it was false.&mdash;Patrick himself said the report was
false.&nbsp; I then said, &ldquo;what did Mr. Church state
respecting its having been reported that he was in
liquor?&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Patrick replied, &ldquo;that that was
false, and that there had been a great deal of
exaggeration.&nbsp; I never put the question to Mr. Patrick,
&ldquo;whether he thought that Church was implicated in the
transaction or not?&rdquo;&nbsp; I never used these words or any
to the same effect.&nbsp; I put these words to him,
&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;You did nothing.&nbsp; Did Mr.
Church acknowledge nothing to you?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;No,
Sir,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;he did not.&rdquo;&nbsp; I said,
&ldquo;as you can bring nothing against him, let us pray for him,
if he was under any such temptation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The phrase which the witness uses seems to signify that the
Defendant&rsquo;s disposition was not very proper.&nbsp; What
occasion was there to pray for him not to be guilty of such an
offence?&nbsp; What temptation could there be to a moral man to
excite him to the commission of so unnatural a crime?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Patrick never delivered any opinion to me, whether
he thought Church was implicated in the transaction or not.&nbsp;
Nothing more passed at the meeting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On his cross-examination he said, &ldquo;I heard of this
business two or three days after it happened.&nbsp; My wife and I
were desirous that Mr. Patrick should go to Mr.
Church&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Mr. Patrick brought the boy to me, in order
to have him brought face to face with Mr. Church.&nbsp; Mr.
Patrick said that the boy was outside.&nbsp; He did not
particularly wish me to see the boy; but I certainly supposed
that he brought the boy for the purpose of going to Mr.
Church&rsquo;s house.&nbsp; Mr. Patrick and I went together, and
the boy followed.&nbsp; The boy did not go in with Mr.
Patrick.&nbsp; He staid outside the door.&nbsp; He walked on the
other side of the way.&nbsp; He waited whilst I waited.&nbsp; We
both waited outside.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now, gentlemen, there is something in the manner in which this
person gave his evidence, which leads me to conclude that he has
not given a correct representation of all that had passed between
him and Mr. Patrick; in the first place he says, that Mr. Patrick
told him that Mr. Church now said nothing.&nbsp; Now that is most
extraordinary.&nbsp; Can it be believed that Mr. Church had said
nothing, or that Patrick had told the witness so?&nbsp; Well,
then, as to the rest of his conduct, Mr. Patrick had brought the
source of his own information, namely the boy, to the witness, in
order that the person who brought forward the accusation might by
examined by Mr. Thomas himself, if he chose to inquire into the
subject.&nbsp; <a name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
65</span>Mr. Patrick brought him to go to Mr. Church&rsquo;s, and
the boy and Mr. Thomas were left outside the door; for he says,
&ldquo;He and I waited outside of the door:&rdquo; but Mr. Thomas
never thinks it worth his while to ask the boy a single
question.&nbsp; He never troubles himself to examine into the
extent of the charge, or inquire into the foundation of it.&nbsp;
But he says, &ldquo;Mr. Patrick was to go in and learn what Mr.
Church said; and then the boy and I were to go in too.&nbsp; Mr.
Patrick took the boy with him, in order that he might be taken in
to see Mr. Church face to face.&nbsp; He brought the boy with
him, and I suppose that was his intention.&nbsp; I declined
introducing the boy to Mr. Church, because I had no particular
acquaintance with Mr. Church.&nbsp; I was only one of his
hearers; and I thought it was too great a liberty for me to speak
to him upon the subject.&nbsp; Mr. Patrick wanted me to go into
Mr. Church first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Why, Gentlemen, who was more proper to inquire into such a
subject, than a person who attended the defendant in the
celebration of divine worship?&nbsp; But Mr. Thomas says, he
thought it would be an obtrusion for him to go into Mr.
Church&rsquo;s house.&nbsp; What obtrusion could it be in a case
of such momentous consequence, where the character and honour of
his spiritual teacher were at stake?&nbsp; Why send Mr. Patrick
if it was an obtrusion, and if the matter was of so delicate a
nature?</p>
<p>Well,&mdash;he goes on to say, &ldquo;I suppose the purpose of
bringing the boy was, that he should be introduced to Mr.
Church&mdash;I have no doubt about it.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know
any other reason for his being brought&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know
that Mr. Patrick said that was his reason.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t
know that he said any thing about inviting me to go to with the
boy&mdash;I don&rsquo;t recollect that he did.&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t remember declining to go in with Mr. Patrick.&nbsp; I
had told him that I had no particular interest in the
business.&nbsp; I had no more intimacy with Mr. Church except
hearing him&mdash;I thought that being only a hearer, my visit
would be obtrusive.&nbsp; I had no particular interest in the
affair, and therefore I declined going in, or taking the boy with
me.&nbsp; I saw no necessity, if the defendant did not
acknowledge himself guilty of any thing bad.&nbsp; Though the boy
was there, I had not the curiosity to examine him, it being a
delicate subject.&nbsp; I did not see the importance of coming at
the truth of the case, as Mr. Church did not confess any thing;
but if Mr. Church had confessed any thing, I should have thought
it my duty to take the boy in, and have them face to
face.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This, Gentlemen, is a most extraordinary account which Mr.
Thomas gives of himself.&nbsp; If he found Mr. Church guilty, he
would have confronted the boy with him!&nbsp; But if he denied
his guilt, he would not think it necessary to examine the
boy!&nbsp; One would have thought that a sense of justice to the
defendant, in such a case, would have prompted him to enquire
whether the charge was not founded in malice.&nbsp; But no; with
the opportunity of questioning the boy on the spot, he leaves the
matter untouched.</p>
<p>He says, &ldquo;When Mr. Patrick came out and said that Mr.
Church did not acknowledge any thing of it, he did not think it
necessary then to have the boy in.&rdquo;&nbsp; He says, &ldquo;I
never spoke to <a name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
66</span>the boy; I never asked Mr. Patrick, nor did he give any
opinion about whether Mr. Church was implicated in the
transaction; but in answer to particular parts of the
transaction, he said Mr. Church asserted that it was false.&nbsp;
I never saw the letter sent to Mrs. Hunter about the three points
of denial.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next witness called is James Reeves; and he says, &ldquo;I
was the Clerk attending the Magistrate when this charge was made
at Union Hall.&nbsp; The Magistrate was Mr. Serjeant
Sellon.&nbsp; The examination took place on the 19th
November.&nbsp; This being a charge of misdemeanour, no account
was committed to writing of what the witnesses said.&nbsp; It was
merely an entry of the names of the parties and the result.&nbsp;
In the first instance, the depositions were taken down upon which
the warrant was granted, but I had no instructions to bring the
book in which that examination appears.&nbsp; There was an
examination afterwards, when the defendant was ordered to find
bail, but the evidence was not then taken down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Wood is the last witness, and he says, &ldquo;I was
present at the examination of Church before the magistrate, I am
a hatter near the Elephant and Castle.&nbsp; I did not take down
the testimony of the witness in writing.&nbsp; Freemantle&rsquo;s
boy said that he went into the Pottery and told the Potter that
there were thieves in the house; and the Potter and he came to
search the house.&nbsp; He was asked by Mr. Sellon whether or no
he searched the room where Mr. Church slept, and he said no, he
did not search that room.&nbsp; Mr. Sellon said &ldquo;why not
search the room?&rdquo; and the answer he gave was &ldquo;that
the Potter wished to break the door open.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Sellon
said &ldquo;did you try the door to see whether it was open
before you talked of breaking it open?&rdquo; he said &ldquo;no,
he did not wish to disturb his Mistress.&rdquo;&nbsp; I cannot
charge my memory whether, whilst the Potter was examined, he said
any thing about what the alarm was, that the boy Foreman gave
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now, gentlemen, this is the whole of the evidence on both
sides, if you don&rsquo;t find any material inroad in the
examination of either the boy or Mr. Patrick, you will have to
say whether the Defendant be or be not guilty, upon their
evidence you will have to say whether you believe the boy&rsquo;s
statement, which is in substance this,&mdash;that when he was
asleep he was awakened by the indecent application to his person
and his private parts, of some person&rsquo;s hand, who said, in
a feigned female voice, &ldquo;Adam don&rsquo;t you know me, I am
your Mistress.&rdquo;&nbsp; The boy swears most positively that
the voice was that of the defendant, and he also swears to his
person,&mdash;taking this along with you, that there was no other
male in the house.&nbsp; The point for your consideration is,
supposing this attack to be made upon his person, was it made
with the abominable intention charged in this Indictment?&nbsp;
If you are of opinion that the person who made this attempt made
it with an intention to commit the crime alledged, then the next
question for your consideration is,&mdash;was it made by the
defendant Mr. Church?&nbsp; The prosecutor says, that he had an
opportunity of observing the person who entered the room: he was
a man of the defendant&rsquo;s size; it was not the person of
Mrs. Patrick nor of the maid, <a name="page67"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 67</span>and there was no other man in the
house.&nbsp; The other material evidence is, that of Mr. Patrick,
who states the communication which he had with the
defendant&mdash;he says, the defendant contradicted three
particulars of the boy&rsquo;s statement: but, the contradiction
does not go to the fact of his having been in the room.&nbsp; He
admits that he was in the room.&nbsp; Then if he was in the room
for what purpose was he there?&nbsp; What excuse is there to be
found for his being in the room?&nbsp; If he was in that room,
for what other object could he be there than that which this boy
states?&mdash;Can you suppose that the boy&rsquo;s story is the
mere invention of his own brain, or the creature of his own
imagination?&nbsp; If you find the fact admitted on all hands,
that the defendant was there, for what earthly purpose could he
be there, than that imputed to him?&nbsp; Gentlemen, the whole is
for your consideration.&nbsp; I have no doubt you have paid great
attention to the proofs both on the part of the prosecution and
that of the defence.&nbsp; You will lay your heads together, and
I am persuaded, you will pronounce that verdict, which your
conscience dictates, and the evidence requires.</p>
<p>The Jury immediately found the Defendant <span
class="smcap">Guilty</span>.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
